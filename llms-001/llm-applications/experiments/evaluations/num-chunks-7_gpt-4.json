            "generated_answer": "When using Ray Data type conversions with `map_batches`, there are a few things to keep in mind. \n\nFirst, Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default. To configure the batch type, you can specify the `batch_format` parameter in `map_batches()`. You can return either format (NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames) from your function.\n\nIf you are working with large datasets, be cautious of potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\n\nTo transform batches with tasks, you can call `map_batches()`. Ray Data uses tasks by default. You can define a function that takes a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays as input and returns a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays as output. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness)\n)\n```\n\nYou can also specify the batch format in methods like `Dataset.iter_batches()` and `Dataset.map_batches()` to specify the batch type. For example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\ndataset = ray.data.range(10)\nnext(iter(dataset.iter_batches(batch_format=\"numpy\", batch_size=5)))\n# Output: {'id': array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])}\n\nnext(iter(dataset.iter_batches(batch_format=\"pandas\", batch_size=5)))\n# Output:\n#    id\n# 0   0\n# 1   1\n# 2   2\n# 3   3\n# 4   4\n```\n\nWhen working with Torch tensors, transformations applied with `map` or `map_batches` can return Torch tensors. However, under the hood, Ray Data automatically converts Torch tensors to NumPy arrays. Subsequent transformations accept NumPy arrays as input, not Torch tensors.\n\nIf your tensors vary in shape, Ray Data represents batches as arrays of object dtype. The individual elements of these object arrays are regular ndarrays.",
            "reference_answer": "You can specify the batch format in the map_batches() function. If you're working with NumPy ndarrays, your function should accept and return a dictionary of ndarrays. If you're working with pandas DataFrames, your function should accept and return a DataFrame.

            "generated_answer": "In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically adjusting the number of replicas for a deployment based on its load. The Ray Serve autoscaler, which is an application-level autoscaler, interacts with the Ray Autoscaler to start or stop replica actors based on the demand for requests. If there are not enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod in Kubernetes, scales the cluster up by increasing the number of worker nodes when the resource demands exceed the current capacity. Conversely, it removes idle worker nodes from the cluster. The autoscaler can be configured using the Ray cluster launcher or on Kubernetes using the Ray autoscaler. It is important to note that Ray Serve Autoscaling allows the minimum number of replicas to be set to 0, and the scale-up process starts when traffic is received. However, there may be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the request. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. For more information on autoscaling, refer to the user guides for Ray clusters on VMs and Kubernetes.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Write your LLM application as a single Python module, combining prompt preprocessing, vector database lookups, LLM API calls, and response validation.\n\n2. Use Ray Serve to rapidly prototype, develop, and deploy your LLM application to production. Ray Serve supports any arbitrary Python code, making development and testing easy.\n\n3. Deploy your Ray Serve LLM application to production using the Ray Serve CLI. You can use the command `serve deploy` and provide a config file path. This will deploy the file to a Ray cluster over HTTP.\n\n4. You can deploy your Serve application to a local, single-node cluster or a remote, multi-node cluster started with the Ray Cluster Launcher.\n\n5. Configure your deployments in Ray Serve to scale out by increasing the number of deployment replicas and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs.\n\n6. To inspect the status of your Serve application in production, you can use the Ray agent address. Make sure to check the environment variable to ensure you're using the desired Ray agent address.\n\n7. For heavyweight code updates, such as runtime_env changes, start a new Ray Cluster, update your Serve config file, and deploy the file with `serve deploy` to the new cluster. Once the new deployment is finished, switch your traffic to the new cluster.\n\nIn Ray Serve, deployments are the central concept. A deployment contains the business logic or ML model to handle incoming requests and can be scaled up to run across a Ray cluster.

Use the `ray logs` command: You can use the `ray logs` command to get logs based on the filename (cluster) or resource identifiers (actor). For example, you can use `ray logs cluster` to get all the log files available on a node. You can also specify a specific log file and tail a certain number of lines using the `--tail` option. For example, `ray logs cluster raylet.out --tail 500` will print the last 500 lines of `raylet.out` on a head node. You can also use `ray logs` as an alias for `ray logs cluster`.\n\n3. Check the output of the Ray job using `kubectl logs`: If you are using Kubernetes to run your Ray job, you can use the `kubectl logs -l=job-name=rayjob-sample` command to check the output of the Ray job.\n\n4. Check the Driver logs: If the Ray Job is submitted by the Job API, the Job logs are available from the Dashboard. The log file follows the format: `job-driver-<job_submission_id>.log`. However, if you execute the Driver directly on the Head Node of the Ray Cluster or run with Ray Client, the Driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, you can see the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output to view the Driver logs.\n\n5. Check Task and Actor Logs (Worker logs): Task and Actor logs can provide useful information for troubleshooting Ray applications. You can use the `ray logs actor` command to follow the log file with an actor ID, or use the `ray logs task` command to get the stderr generated by a task. Note that if a task is from a concurrent actor (i.e., an async actor or a threaded actor), the logs of the tasks may be interleaved, so it's recommended to use `ray logs actor --id` for the entire actor log.\n\nRemember that Ray does not provide a native storage solution for log data, so you need to manage the lifecycle of the logs yourself.",
            "reference_answer": "To quickly narrow down the root cause of a failed ray job, you should first check the application logs, specifically the 'job-driver-[submission_id].log' and 'worker-[worker_id]-[job_id]-[pid].[out|err]' files. These logs contain the stdout and stderr from Tasks or Actors, which can provide insights into any errors or issues that occurred during the job execution. If these logs do not provide sufficient information, you can then check the system logs. The 'raylet.[out|err]' log file can be particularly useful as it contains logs from the raylets, which are the core system processes in Ray. Additionally, the 'runtime_env_setup-[job_id].log' file can provide information about the job's environment and dependencies, which could also help identify any issues.",

To tolerate head node failures, it is necessary to make the Global Control Store (GCS) fault tolerant so that when a new head node is started, all the cluster-level data is still available.\n\n2. Worker node failure: Worker nodes can fail due to various reasons. This can be simulated by killing the worker pod or the worker node. When a worker node fails, it can impact tasks, actors, and objects running on that node.\n\n3. Overloading the head node: If the head node is overloaded with too many simultaneous connections, it can result in routing issues and failures. Starting the worker nodes more slowly can help mitigate this problem.\n\n4. Temporary directories: Temporary directories on the nodes may get cleared up whenever the machines reboot. This can result in the loss of log files when the cluster or some of the nodes are stopped or terminated. To inspect logs after the clusters are stopped or terminated, it is necessary to store and persist the logs.\n\nIt is important to note that these are general reasons for node failures in a cluster, and the specific reasons can vary depending on the cluster setup and configuration.",

Efficient resource utilization: Using a singleton actor allows for reusing model initialization for multiple tasks, resulting in more efficient resource utilization. This means that the node will spend more time on the actual workload.\n\n2. Flexible task scheduling: By using a singleton actor, all the required actors and other defined tasks can run concurrently. This provides more flexibility in task scheduling.\n\n3. Stateful operations: Actors can hold global state using instance variables, allowing for easy modification and access to the state. This is particularly useful when stateful operations are required.\n\nThe disadvantages of using a singleton actor include:\n\n1. Limited use cases: If the stateful part of an actor is not needed, it is generally more efficient to use tasks instead. This implies that singleton actors may not be suitable for all scenarios.\n\n2. Lack of support for class variables: Using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported in singleton actors. Each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, resulting in each actor having its own copy of the class variables.\n\n3. Alternative concurrency options: Threaded actors can also be used to achieve concurrency, providing an alternative option to singleton actors.\n\nOverall, the decision to use a singleton actor should be based on the specific requirements of the application and the need for stateful operations.",

Move the data loader to the training function: The warning suggests that the actor TrainTrainable is very large. Check if its definition is implicitly capturing a large array or object in scope. To resolve this, you can use ray.put() to put large objects in the Ray object store.\n\n2. Check the batch size: Another warning states that to ensure full parallelization across an actor pool of size 4, the specified batch size should be at most 5. If your configured batch size for this operator is 16, you should reduce it to a value that allows full parallelization, such as 5.\n\n3. Use GPUs for inference: If you have access to large GPUs and want to utilize them for inference, you can make the following changes to your code:\n   - Update the class implementation to move the model and data to and from the GPU.\n   - Specify num_gpus=1 in the ds.map_batches() call to indicate that each actor should use 1 GPU.\n   - Specify a batch_size for inference. Refer to the documentation for more details on configuring the batch size.\n\n4. Transform batches with actors: If you want to transform batches with actors, you can follow these steps:\n   - Implement a class that performs setup in __init__ and transforms data in __call__.\n   - Create an ActorPoolStrategy and configure the number of concurrent workers. Each worker will transform a partition of data.\n   - Call map_batches() and pass your ActorPoolStrategy to compute.\n\nMake sure to review and modify your code accordingly based on the above suggestions to resolve the ValueError.",

Define a function to process each file. This function should be decorated with `@ray.remote` to make it a Ray remote function. Inside this function, you can write the code to read and process the data from each file.\n\n3. Use Ray Data operations to load and preprocess the data in a streaming fashion. Ray Data provides flexible and performant APIs for distributed data processing, such as simple transformations like `map_batches()`, global and grouped aggregations like `groupby()`, and shuffling operations like `random_shuffle()`, `sort()`, and `repartition()`.\n\n4. Iterate over your files and call the remote processing function on each file using `ray.remote().remote(file)`. This will distribute the processing of files across the available Ray nodes.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Assume this Ray node has 16 CPUs and 16G memory.\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\ndef process(file):\n    # Actual work is reading the file and processing the data.\n    # Assume it needs to use 2G memory.\n    pass\n\n# Iterate over your files and call the remote processing function on each file.\nfile_list = [...]  # List of file paths\nresult_ids = [process.remote(file) for file in file_list]\n\n# Wait for all processing tasks to complete\nray.get(result_ids)\n```\n\nNote that Ray Data is particularly suited for offline batch inference and data preprocessing and ingest for ML training. It provides a wide range of preprocessing operations for transforming your data prior to training. However, for unstructured data, it is recommended to use existing Ray Data operations instead of preprocessors. For more details and examples, you can refer to the Ray Data documentation.",

            "question": "How does Ray work with async.io ?",
            "generated_answer": "Ray works with async.io by allowing the invocation of every remote operation to be asynchronous. When a remote operation is called, it immediately returns a promise/future, which is an identifier (ID) of the operation's result. This allows for parallelism, as multiple operations can be launched in parallel. To retrieve the actual results, the programmer needs to call `ray.get()` on the IDs of the results, which blocks until the results are available.\n\nRay natively integrates with asyncio, which is a concurrent programming framework in Python. This means that Ray can be used alongside popular async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. Ray also enables arbitrary functions to be executed asynchronously on separate Python workers, which are called \"tasks\". These tasks can specify their resource requirements in terms of CPUs, GPUs, and custom resources, and the cluster scheduler distributes the tasks across the cluster for parallelized execution.\n\nIt's important to note that running blocking `ray.get()` or `ray.wait()` inside an async actor method is not allowed, as it would block the execution of the event loop. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time, although tasks can be multiplexed. If a threadpool is desired, Threaded Actors can be used.\n\nThe Ray Client can be used to interact with RayServe, a framework for serving Python functions as web services. RayServeSyncHandle blocks the current thread until the request is matched to a replica, while RayServeHandle returns an asyncio.Task upon submission, which can be awaited to resolve to a ray.ObjectRef. This allows for concurrent processing of requests while the current request is buffered.\n\nOverall, Ray provides a way to work with async.io by enabling asynchronous remote operations, integrating with asyncio, and allowing for parallel execution of tasks.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray integrates natively with asyncio and allows for concurrent code execution using async/await syntax. It supports async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. Ray provides AsyncActor class for defining actors that can run concurrent tasks. ObjectRefs in Ray can be translated to asyncio.Futures or concurrent.futures.Future objects, allowing to await on ray futures in existing concurrent applications. Ray runs all of the methods inside a single python event loop. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time.

Check if you are calling `ray.get()` too early. It is best practice to wait as long as possible before calling `ray.get()`, or even design your program to avoid calling it at all.\n3. Avoid calling `ray.get()` in a loop, as it is a blocking call and will wait until the requested result is available. This can harm parallelism and prevent the loop from continuing to run until the call to `ray.get()` is resolved.\n4. Separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. This allows all remote functions to be spawned before waiting for the results, enabling them to run in parallel in the background.\n5. Instead of calling `ray.get()` one by one, you can pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` to wait for all tasks to finish.\n6. If you need to debug the hanging `ray.get()` call, you can use Ray's debugger. After running the program and calling `ray debug`, you can select the breakpoint and jump into the call with the `remote` command. Inside the function, you can print the value of the object reference to debug the issue.\n\nRemember to avoid calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily for intermediate steps.

Here is an example of how to add a log message inside an actor:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Basic config automatically configures logs to\n        # stream to stdout and stderr.\n        # Set the severity to INFO so that info logs are printed to stdout.\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Actor` class is defined as a remote actor using the `@ray.remote` decorator. Inside the `Actor` class, there is a `log` method that takes a message as input and logs it using the `logging` module. The log message is sent to the actor using the `remote` method, and `ray.get` is used to retrieve the result.\n\nYou can customize the log messages by defining the `__repr__` method for the `Actor` class. This allows you to distinguish between log messages from different actors.",
            "reference_answer": "To add a log inside an actor in Ray, you need to customize the logger configuration when you define the Actor. First, import the necessary modules. Then, initiate a driver using ray.init(). Define your Actor class and within it, set the logging level using logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO). Define a method for logging where you get the logger using logging.getLogger(__name__) and log your message using logger.info(msg). Finally, create an instance of your Actor and call the log method with your message.",

The `--working-dir` option in the command line allows you to specify the directory containing files that your application will run in. It can be a local directory or a remote URI to a .zip file.\n\n3. The `code search path` for Java workers can be specified as one or more directories split by a \":\". This is also used for loading Python code if specified.\n\n4. The `RAY_HOSTDIR` environment variable can be used to control the directory name in the inner container.\n\n5. The `chdir_to_trial_dir` parameter, although deprecated, can be used to change the working directory of each worker to its corresponding trial directory.\n\nOverall, the context suggests that there are multiple ways to specify working directories depending on the specific use case and programming language being used.",

Start by reading the \"RayCluster Quickstart\" guide, which provides an overview of managing and interacting with Ray clusters on Kubernetes.\n\n2. Next, refer to the \"RayCluster Configuration\" guide, which covers the key aspects of Ray cluster configuration on Kubernetes.\n\n3. The deployments of Ray on Kubernetes follow the operator pattern. You will need to work with a custom resource called a \"RayCluster\" that describes the desired state of the Ray cluster. There is also a custom controller called the \"KubeRay operator\" that manages Ray pods to match the RayCluster's specification.\n\n4. To deploy a Ray cluster, create a RayCluster custom resource (CR) using the command: `kubectl apply -f raycluster.yaml`. This guide provides more details on configuring the RayCluster CR.\n\n5. If you want to configure and manage the Ray Dashboard, which is a tool for monitoring and debugging Ray applications and clusters, refer to the \"Configuring and Managing Ray Dashboard\" guide. It explains how to set up Ray Dashboard on your clusters and mentions optional integrations with Prometheus and Grafana for an enhanced experience.\n\n6. The RayService provides Kubernetes-native support for Ray clusters and Ray Serve applications. You can define a Ray cluster and its Ray Serve applications using a Kubernetes config and then use `kubectl` to create the cluster and applications. In-place updates for Ray Serve applications are also possible by updating the RayService CR config and using `kubectl apply`.\n\n7. The RayJob provides Kubernetes-native support for Ray clusters and Ray jobs. You can define a Ray cluster and job using a Kubernetes config and create them using `kubectl`. The cluster can be automatically deleted once the job is finished.\n\n8. Finally, to deploy the Ray cluster, use the provided configuration file and apply it using the appropriate command. The recommended configuration is to schedule one Ray pod per 16-CPU Kubernetes node, but it is not required. It is generally more efficient to use a few large Ray pods rather than many small ones.\n\nPlease refer to the specific guides mentioned in the context for more detailed instructions on each step.",

The Ray cluster has fault tolerance enabled by default using the external Redis, and you need to set the Redis IP address in the config. Once the Ray cluster has been deployed, you can view the pods for the head node and worker nodes by running '! kubectl get pods'. Wait for the pods to reach the Running state. If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can check for errors via 'kubectl describe pod deployment-ray-head-xxxx-xxxxx' and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.",

            "generated_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the issue you are facing with the Ray Dashboard disappearing after tunneling the port could be due to a few reasons. Here are some possible explanations and solutions:\n\n1. Port Forwarding: When tunneling the dashboard port from the head node to your machine, make sure that the port forwarding is correctly set up. Double-check the port number and ensure that it is being forwarded to the correct IP address and port on your local machine.\n\n2. Authentication: The context mentions that exposing the Ray Dashboard publicly without proper authentication is not recommended for security purposes. Make sure that you have implemented proper authentication measures before exposing the dashboard.\n\n3. Customizing the Dashboard Port: By default, the Ray Dashboard runs on port 8265 of the head node. If you need to customize the port, follow the instructions provided in the context to specify the desired port using the `--dashboard-port` argument with the `ray start` command or the `dashboard_port` keyword argument in `ray.init()`.\n\n4. Dependencies and Runtime Environment: Ensure that the import path is accessible when running on a remote cluster. Check the documentation on handling dependencies to add a runtime environment if necessary.\n\n5. Dashboard Component Availability: Make sure that the dashboard component is included when starting the Ray cluster. This is usually the default behavior for `ray start` and `ray.init()`. If the dashboard component is not available, the dashboard agent's HTTP server will fail.\n\n6. Debugging: If you encounter further issues or need more in-depth debugging, you can check the dashboard log at `<RAY_LOG_DIR>/dashboard.log`, which is usually located at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/dashboard.log`.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the Ray Dashboard is an alpha feature and requires a full installation of Ray using `pip install \"ray[default]\"`. Additionally, integrations with Prometheus and Grafana are optional for an enhanced dashboard experience.\n\nIf the above solutions do not resolve your issue, it may be helpful to consult the official Ray documentation or seek support from the Ray community for further assistance.",

This can be done by specifying the `working_dir` parameter when initializing Ray workers. The `working_dir` can be a local existing directory with a total size of up to 100 MiB, a local existing zipped file with a total unzipped size of up to 100 MiB, or a URI to a remotely-stored zip file containing the working directory for your job.\n\n2. If you want to disable the behavior of changing the working directory, you can set the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR` environment variable to 0. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes. Make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\n3. The working directory of the Trainable worker will be automatically changed to the corresponding Trial directory. This means that you don't need to worry about multiple workers saving to the same location. You can access relative file paths in your Tune training function.\n\n4. If you want to write to a file directly, you can use the `open` function and specify the file path relative to the trial directory. For example:\n\n```python\nwith open(f\"./artifact_{self.iteration}.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(\"Artifact Data\")\n```\n\n5. If you need to move files manually or upload files from a local path, you can use the `ray rsync-up` command. For example:\n\n```bash\nray rsync-up lm-cluster.yaml PATH/TO/LM '~/efs/lm'\n```\n\nThis command will upload files from the local path to the specified destination.\n\nNote: The provided information is based on the context provided and may vary depending on the specific use case or framework being used.",

            "generated_answer": "The GCS server, or Global Control Service server, is responsible for managing cluster-level metadata and performing cluster-level operations such as actor, placement group, and node management. By default, the GCS server is not fault-tolerant as it stores all data in-memory, and its failure results in the failure of the entire Ray cluster. To make the GCS server fault-tolerant, HA Redis (High Availability Redis) is required.\n\nIf your GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node, it could be because the head node has more memory-demanding system components like the GCS server or the dashboard. Additionally, if the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and you execute the same number of tasks and actors from the head node, it can easily experience out-of-memory problems. To avoid this, you can specify \"--num-cpus=0\" when starting a head node to prevent running any tasks and actors on it.\n\nIt is also important to tune the operating system settings to support the large number of network connections created when all nodes and workers connect to the GCS server.\n\nWhen deploying a large cluster, the head node may experience extra stress due to additional system processes like the GCS server. A recommended starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory, although the actual specification depends on the workload and cluster size.\n\nIn summary, the GCS server manages cluster-level metadata and operations, and if it is taking up a lot of memory on the head node, it could be due to the nature of its functions and the workload being executed.",

Look for error messages like \"This node has an IP address of xx.xx.xx.xx, while we cannot find the matched Raylet address.\" This can occur if you connect the Ray cluster with a different IP address or connect a container. It may also be caused by overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections. The solution is to start the worker nodes more slowly.\n\n2. Ensure that the Ray cluster is already started. If it is, you should not need to run anything on the worker nodes.\n\n3. If your program freezes, you can restart the Ray cluster without running any installation commands by using the following command: `$ ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n\n4. Wait for a while after all nodes have started. If necessary, you can forcefully kill a random node using the command `ray kill-random-node tune-default.yaml --hard`. This will cause Tune to continue the trials on a different worker node. You can also specify a storage path as part of `air.RunConfig` to upload results to cloud storage like S3, allowing you to persist results in case you want to start and stop your cluster automatically.\n\n5. If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can use `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` to check for errors. Make sure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough. In production scenarios, it is recommended to use larger Ray pods and size each Ray pod to take up an entire Kubernetes node.\n\n6.

This can be done on AWS, GCP, or Azure clouds.\n\n2. Choose any ML framework of your choice, such as PyTorch, HuggingFace, or Tensorflow.\n\n3. Ray Data does not require a specific file format and supports various formats like CSV, Parquet, and raw images.\n\n4. To load data, you can create datasets from on-disk files, Python objects, or cloud storage services like S3. Ray Data can read from any filesystem supported by Arrow.\n\n5. Use the `ray.data.read_csv` function to read a CSV file from S3. For example:\n   ```\n   import ray\n   ds = ray.data.read_csv(\"s3://anonymous@air-example-data/iris.csv\")\n   ds.show(limit=1)\n   ```\n\n6. Ray Data requires schemas for all datasets in Ray 2.5. Standalone Python objects are no longer supported. The default batch format is fixed to NumPy. To temporarily revert to legacy behavior, set the environment variable `RAY_DATA_STRICT_MODE=0` on all cluster processes.\n\n7. To create a Ray dataset from parquet files, you can use `ray.data.read_parquet` function. However, note that it can take a long time to execute.\n\n8. Install Ray Data by running `pip install -U \"ray[data]\"`.\n\n9. Follow the four basic steps for using Ray Data for offline inference: Load your data into a Ray Dataset, define a Python class to load the pre-trained model, transform your dataset using the pre-trained model by calling `ds.map_batches()`.

            "generated_answer": "To avoid shuffling your dataset during a `ray.data.map_batches()` operation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Randomize each block of your dataset by using the `randomize_block_order()` function.\n2. Enable local shuffling by specifying a `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter when iterating over your dataset using `iter_batches()` or `iter_torch_batches()`.\n\nBy randomizing the block order and enabling local shuffling, you can achieve a level of shuffling without incurring the full cost of a global shuffle. This approach is suitable for most cases.\n\nIt's important to note that shuffling operations in Ray Data materialize datasets in memory and are not streamed through memory. Therefore, it's recommended to use a batch size that can comfortably fit into memory to avoid potential out-of-memory situations.\n\nRay Data is a scalable data processing library for ML workloads, providing flexible and performant APIs for distributed data processing, including simple transformations, global and grouped aggregations, and shuffling operations. It is particularly suited for offline batch inference, data preprocessing and ingest for ML training.\n\nFor more information on shuffle performance and other performance tips and tuning, refer to the \"Performance Tips and Tuning\" guide.",

Set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to the IP address of the head node and the port on which Grafana is hosted. For example, if the IP of the head node is 55.66.77.88 and Grafana is hosted on port 3000, set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` as `http://55.66.77.88:3000`.\n\n2.

Use the `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` variable to set an address that the user's browsers can use to access Grafana and embed visualizations. If `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` is not set, Ray Dashboard will use the value of `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`.\n\nBy properly setting all the environment variables mentioned above, you should be able to see time-series metrics in the Ray Dashboard.",

For example, you can set `num_gpus=1` to request one GPU for the map tasks. Ray natively supports GPUs as a pre-defined resource type, allowing tasks and actors to specify their GPU resource requirements.\n\nAdditionally, Ray provides GPU isolation by automatically setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable, which most machine learning frameworks will respect for GPU assignment. This ensures that tasks are pinned to a physical GPU.\n\nIt's worth noting that Ray currently officially supports x86_64, aarch64 (ARM) for Linux, and Apple silicon (M1) hardware.

In this case, you can use the `--no-wait` flag when submitting the job using the `ray job submit` command. You can then use other CLI commands to check the status of the job.\n\nIt's worth noting that Ray Client is recommended for developing interactively in a local Python shell, but it requires a stable connection to the remote cluster. If the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds, the workload will be terminated. For long-running workloads, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs instead.\n\nPlease refer to the specific Ray configuration or CLI commands for more details on how to add a timeout for your Ray job.",

Ensure that the directory specified in RAY_TEMPDIR is accessible by the host and the outer container.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to make sure TensorBoard is able to write to the tmp directory, you can run the following commands:\n\n```\n$ export TMPDIR=/tmp/$USER\n$ mkdir -p $TMPDIR\n$ tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results\n```\n\nWhen connecting to a remote cluster, you may need to access the dashboard port of the cluster over HTTP. One way to do this is by port forwarding 127.0.0.1:8265 on your local machine to 127.0.0.1:8265 on the head node. If you started your remote cluster with the Ray Cluster Launcher, you can set up the port forwarding automatically using the `ray dashboard` command.\n\nTo use the `ray dashboard` command, run the following command on your local machine, replacing `cluster.yaml` with the configuration file you used to launch your cluster:\n\n```\nray dashboard cluster.yaml\n```\n\nNote that for production settings, it is recommended to build any necessary packages into a container image instead.

            "generated_answer": "To avoid objects from getting spilled in Ray, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. Increase the capacity of the object store: Objects are spilled to external storage when the capacity of the object store is used up. By increasing the capacity, you can reduce the likelihood of objects getting spilled. \n\n2. Use an SSD instead of an HDD: It is recommended to use an SSD (Solid State Drive) instead of an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. SSDs have faster read and write speeds, which can improve the performance of object spilling.\n\n3. Specify a large buffer size: If you are using an HDD, it is recommended to specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. This can help optimize the performance of object spilling.\n\n4. Configure the directory for object spilling: By default, objects are spilled to Ray's temporary directory in the local filesystem. However, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using the appropriate settings in your code.\n\nPlease note that object spilling comes with a performance penalty since data needs to be written to disk. It is important to consider the trade-off between memory usage and performance when using object spilling for memory-intensive distributed applications.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",
