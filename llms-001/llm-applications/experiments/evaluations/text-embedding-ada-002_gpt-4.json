            "generated_answer": "If you use AsyncIO's `await` to wait for a Ray future like `await x.remote()`, it means you are waiting for the result of the remote operation to be available. With Ray, every remote operation is asynchronous, so when you invoke a remote operation, it immediately returns a promise/future, which is essentially an identifier (ID) of the operation's result. By using `await`, you are suspending the execution of the current coroutine until the result is available.\n\nIn the provided context, it is mentioned that Ray allows the invocation of remote operations to be asynchronous, and the programmer needs to call `ray.get()` on the IDs of the results to retrieve the actual results. However, instead of using `ray.get()`, you can use AsyncIO's `await` to wait for the Ray future to be resolved. This allows you to integrate Ray futures with existing concurrent applications that use AsyncIO.\n\nIt is important to note that if you use `ray.get()` or `await` to wait for the result of a remote operation, it will block the execution until the result is available. This means that if you wait for a remote operation to finish before spawning the next call in a loop, you will not achieve parallelism. To achieve parallelism, you should launch multiple remote operations and then wait for their results asynchronously using `await` or `ray.get()`.\n\nIn summary, using AsyncIO's `await` to wait for a Ray future allows you to wait for the result of a remote operation asynchronously, enabling parallelism in your program.",
            "reference_answer": "If you use AsyncIO's await to wait for a Ray future like `await x.remote()`, it will allow you to wait for the completion of the remote task.

Ray ensures that the sum of the resource requirements of all concurrently running tasks and actors on a node does not exceed the node's total resources. It is recommended to adjust the resource requirements of each task instead of manually controlling task parallelism. Additionally, the Ray head node, which has memory-demanding system components, can easily have out-of-memory problems if the same number of tasks and actors are executed from it.

Here is an example code snippet:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef spread_func():\n    return 2\n\n@ray.remote(num_cpus=1)\nclass SpreadActor:\n    pass\n\n# Spread tasks across the cluster.\n[spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n\n# Spread actors across the cluster.\nactors = [SpreadActor.options(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\").remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\n\nThis code will create 10 tasks and 10 actors, and the \"SPREAD\" strategy will distribute them evenly across the cluster.\n\nAdditionally, if you have multiple tasks that need to wait on some condition or synchronize across tasks and actors on a cluster, you can use a central actor to coordinate among them.\n\nTo debug performance problems and ensure load balancing, you can use `random_access_ds.stats()`, which returns a string showing the actor-side measured latencies and the distribution of data blocks and queries across the actors. Load imbalances can cause bottlenecks, so it's important to evenly distribute the load across the key space to avoid this.\n\nIf you have a large model that needs to be loaded and passed efficiently in a Ray cluster, the recommended approach is to let the driver load the model from a storage system, use `ray.put(model)` to store the model into the object store, and then pass the same reference of the model to each remote task when launching them.",

            "generated_answer": "The connection refused error when running `ray debug` on a remote Ray cluster is likely due to not specifying the correct address for the cluster. To connect to a remote cluster using Ray Client, you need to use the `ray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:10001\")` command, where `<head_node_host>` is the IP address or hostname of the head node of your remote cluster.\n\nIt is important to note that Ray Client requires a stable connection to the remote cluster and will terminate the workload if the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds. If you have a long-running workload, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs instead.\n\nIn the provided context, there are examples of connection attempts to Ray clusters. One attempt shows connecting to an existing Ray cluster at address `192.168.2.61:6379`, and another attempt shows connecting to an existing Ray cluster at address `127.0.0.1:6379`. Make sure you are using the correct address for your remote cluster when running `ray debug`.\n\nIf you are developing locally and want to connect to an existing cluster, you can use `ray.init()` without specifying an address. This will connect to the latest Ray cluster. However, note that the machine calling `ray.init()` will not be considered part of the Ray cluster.\n\nTo start a local cluster, you can run `ray.init()` without specifying an address. This will automatically create a local cluster and attach to it. The Ray dashboard can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:8265`.\n\nMake sure you are using the appropriate `ray.init()` command based on your use case and cluster setup.",

First, import Ray Train and Ray AIR Session using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport ray.train as train\n```\n\nThis will allow you to distribute the training across multiple workers and use data-parallel training by sharding the training data. The model will then be able to communicate gradient updates across machines. Once the training is complete, the results can be reported back to Ray Train.\n\nRay Train is a scalable machine learning library for distributed training and fine-tuning. It abstracts away the complexities of distributed computing and allows you to scale model training code from a single machine to a cluster of machines in the cloud. It supports various frameworks, including the PyTorch ecosystem.\n\nRay AIR leverages Ray Data for data loading and Ray Train for distributed training.

            "generated_answer": "To debug the issue of worker nodes dying when using TensorflowTrainer with around 1500 workers, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the logs: The provided context suggests that you can use the command `ray logs raylet.out -ip <node_ip>` to see more information about the workers killed on the specific node. You can replace `<node_ip>` with the IP address of the node where the worker died. This will provide you with detailed logs that can help identify the cause of the issue.\n\n2. Memory pressure and OOM: The logs indicate that some workers were killed due to memory pressure (OOM - Out of Memory). Ray has an application-level memory monitor that kills workers before the Linux out-of-memory killer executes. This is to prevent the system from crashing. You should check the memory usage of your worker nodes and ensure that they have enough resources to handle the workload.\n\n3. TensorFlow optimizations: The logs also mention that the TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use specific CPU instructions. This information is provided for each worker in the cluster. Make sure that your worker nodes meet the CPU requirements for running TensorFlow with these optimizations.\n\n4. Check for other reasons: Apart from memory pressure, there could be other reasons for workers crashing. The logs mention that some workers crashed due to reasons other than memory pressure. It would be helpful to investigate these logs to identify any additional issues or errors that might be causing the worker nodes to die.\n\n5. Routing issues: The context also mentions the possibility of routing issues, where the IP address of a node does not match the Raylet address. This can happen when connecting the Ray cluster with a different IP address or when connecting a container. Ensure that the network configuration is correct and that all nodes can communicate properly.\n\n6. Consider starting worker nodes more slowly: The last part of the context suggests that overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections can cause failures. If you are starting all 1500 worker nodes at once, it might be overwhelming the system. Consider starting the worker nodes more slowly to avoid this issue.\n\nBy following these steps and analyzing the provided logs, you should be able to debug the issue and identify the root cause of the worker nodes dying.",

Overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections can also cause failures. Starting worker nodes more slowly can be a solution.\n\n4. Worker node failure: Simulating a worker node failure can be done by examining the nodes and pods running in the Kubernetes cluster. This can be achieved by using the command \"kubectl get nodes\".\n\n5. Head node failure: Simulating a head node failure can be done by killing the head pod or the head node. To observe the running pods in the cluster, the command \"kubectl get pods -o wide\" can be used.\n\n6. Raylet failure: When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated as a node failure. Even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n\n7. Head node failure: If a head node fails, the entire Ray cluster fails.

Ray Data partitions rows into distributed data blocks to enable parallel operations.\n\nIt is important to note that a large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, it is recommended to ensure that no single item in the Ray Data is too large and to use a small enough batch size when calling `ds.map_batches()` to ensure that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\n\nRay Data provides a higher-level API for offline batch inference with built-in optimizations, allowing for scalable batch prediction on large datasets at high prediction throughput.

For production deployment scenarios, you can refer to the guides for deploying Ray on VMs and Kubernetes for more details.\n\n4. One way to set up dependencies is by using the Ray Cluster launcher. You can prepare a single environment across the cluster before starting the Ray runtime. This can be done by building all your files and dependencies into a container image and specifying it in your Cluster YAML Configuration. Alternatively, you can install packages using setup_commands in the Ray Cluster configuration file, which will be run as each node joins the cluster.\n\n5.

This function takes two datasets as input and returns a new dataset that combines the rows from both datasets based on a specified join condition.\n\nHere is an example of how to join two datasets using Ray:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nimport ray.data\n\n# Create two datasets\ndataset1 = ray.data.from_pandas(...)\ndataset2 = ray.data.from_csv(...)\n\n# Join the datasets\njoined_dataset = ray.data.join(dataset1, dataset2, on=\"column_name\")\n\n# Process the joined dataset\nresult = joined_dataset.map(lambda row: ...)\n\n# Collect the results\noutput = result.collect()\n```\n\nIn this example, `dataset1` and `dataset2` are two Ray datasets that you want to join. The `on` parameter specifies the column name on which the join operation should be performed.\n\nAfter joining the datasets, you can apply any transformations or computations on the joined dataset using the `map` function.

If you need to mutate the array, you will need to make a copy of it in the local process memory. You can do this by using the `copy()` method of the numpy array. For example:\n   ```python\n   arr = arr.copy()\n   ```\n   Note that by making a copy, you effectively disable the zero-copy deserialization feature provided by Ray.\n\nIt is important to note that numpy arrays in Ray are stored as read-only objects, and any writes to the read-only object will require you to first copy it into the local process memory.\n\nHere is an example of how to avoid the read-only assignment issue and manually copy the array if needed:\n```python\ntry:\n    ray.get(f.remote(np.zeros(100)))\nexcept ray.exceptions.RayTaskError as e:\n    print(e)\n    # ValueError: assignment destination is read-only\n    # arr[0] = 1\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively utilize the zero-copy feature provided by Ray for numpy arrays.",

All Ray workers on the same node can read the numpy array in the object store without copying, which is the 'zero-copy' read.

            "generated_answer": "Based on the provided context, it is advised to create \"key pools\" where an actor can hold 1 to many keys rather than spinning up 1=1 actors for each key. This approach is more efficient because it allows for the reuse of model initialization for many tasks, resulting in the node spending more time on the actual workload. Additionally, using an actor-based approach allows for more flexible scheduling of tasks and is recommended when the stateful part of an actor is needed.

Efficiency: Singleton actors reuse model initialization for multiple tasks, allowing the node to spend more time on the actual workload.\n\n2. Concurrency: Threaded actors can be used to achieve concurrency, allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously.\n\n3. Global State Management: Singleton actors can hold the global state and pass the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed. This avoids the use of global variables, which can lead to issues with sharing state between tasks and actors.\n\n4. Object Store Optimization: By avoiding multiple copies of the same object in the object store, the object store is less likely to fill up prematurely and incur the cost of object eviction.\n\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to using singleton actors:\n\n1. Lack of Address Space Sharing: Ray drivers, tasks, and actors run in different processes and do not share the same address space. Modifying global variables in one process does not reflect changes in other processes.\n\n2. Interference and Reliability: Simultaneous jobs can interfere with each other, making them less reliable to run in production. Ray does not support priorities, so there is no way to prioritize important jobs under load.\n\n3.

In this case, since a class is being used, the UDF will run as long-running Ray actors. \n\nFor class-based UDFs, you can use the `compute` argument to specify the `ActorPoolStrategy` with the number of parallel actors. The `batch_size` argument indicates the number of images in each batch.\n\nHere is an example of how you can write the map function:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize any necessary variables or resources\n    \n    def process_batch(self, batch):\n        # Process the batch of data and return a list of objects\n        result = []\n        for data in batch:\n            # Process each data item and generate an object\n            obj = process_data(data)\n            result.append(obj)\n        return result\n\ndef map_batches(data, batch_size):\n    # Split the data into batches\n    batches = [data[i:i+batch_size] for i in range(0, len(data), batch_size)]\n    \n    # Create a list to store the results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Create the actors\n    actors = [MyActor.remote() for _ in range(len(batches))]\n    \n    # Process each batch using the actors\n    for actor, batch in zip(actors, batches):\n        results.append(actor.process_batch.remote(batch))\n    \n    # Get the results\n    results = ray.get(results)\n    \n    # Flatten the results list\n    results = [item for sublist in results for item in sublist]\n    \n    return results\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyActor` class is defined as a long-running Ray actor. The `process_batch` method is responsible for processing each batch of data and returning a list of objects.\n\nThe `map_batches` function takes the input data and the desired batch size as parameters. It splits the data into batches and creates the necessary actors. Then, it processes each batch using the actors and collects the results. Finally, it flattens the results list and returns it.\n\nNote that you need to have Ray installed and initialized before using this code.

Here is an example:\\n\\n```\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef add_dog_years(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch['age_in_dog_years'] = 7 * batch['age']\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.from_items([\n        {'name': 'Luna', 'age': 4},\n        {'name': 'Rory', 'age': 14},\n        {'name': 'Scout', 'age': 9},\n    ])\n    .map_batches(add_dog_years)\n)\nds.show()\n```\\n\\nIn this example, `add_dog_years` is a function that adds a new field `age_in_dog_years` to the input batch.

This parameter divides episodes into fragments of a specified number of steps each during rollouts. Trajectories of this size are collected from rollout workers and combined into a larger batch for learning.\n\nFor example, if you set `rollout_fragment_length` to 100 and `train_batch_size` to 1000, RLlib will collect 10 fragments of 100 steps each from rollout workers. These fragments are then concatenated, and an epoch of SGD is performed.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `complete_episodes` setting to ensure that each rollout only contains full episodes, from the beginning to the terminal state. This means that there will be no episode fragments in the rollout. The `rollout_fragment_length` parameter defines the minimum number of timesteps that will be covered in each rollout.\n\nTo make the buffer store only complete episodes found in a batch, you can use the following configuration line:\n\n`config.training(replay_buffer_config={\"storage_unit\": StorageUnit.EPISODES})`\n\nThis will ensure that the buffer only stores complete episodes and not episode fragments.",

            "generated_answer": "To set the memory limit for each trial in Ray Tuner, you can use the trial's resource specification. There are two options for specifying resources: `resources_per_trial` and `trial.placement_group_factory`. \n\nBy default, `Tuner.fit` will execute until all trials stop or error. You can see the memory usage on each node in the trial run output. For example:\n\n```\n== Status ==\nMemory usage on this node: 11.4/16.0 GiB\nUsing FIFO scheduling algorithm.\nResources requested: 1/12 CPUs, 0/0 GPUs, 0.0/3.17 GiB heap, 0.0/1.07 GiB objects\nResult logdir: /Users/foo/ray_results/myexp\nNumber of trials: 1 (1 RUNNING)\n```\n\nTo limit concurrency in Tune, you can set the maximum number of trials to run concurrently using `max_concurrent_trials` in `TuneConfig`. However, the actual parallelism may be less than `max_concurrent_trials` and will depend on the available resources in the cluster. For example, if you have a trial that requires 16 GPUs, your cluster has 32 GPUs, and `max_concurrent_trials=10`, the Tuner can only run 2 trials concurrently.\n\nTo control console output with Tune, you can use a Reporter object to customize the console output. User-provided fields will be outputted automatically on a best-effort basis. The console output will show the memory usage, resources requested, result log directory, and the number of trials running. For example:\n\n```\n== Status ==\nMemory usage on this node: 11.4/16.0 GiB\nUsing FIFO scheduling algorithm.\nResources requested: 4/12 CPUs, 0/0 GPUs, 0.0/3.17 GiB heap, 0.0/1.07 GiB objects\nResult logdir: /Users/foo/ray_results/myexp\nNumber of trials: 4 (4 RUNNING)\n```\n\nBy default, Tune reports experiment progress periodically to the command-line. The console output will show the same information as mentioned above.\n\nThe trial scheduler in Ray Tune decides how to allocate resources to trials. The most common resource allocated is time, where the scheduler determines which trials to run at what time. Some built-in schedulers like Asynchronous Hyperband (ASHA) perform early stopping of under-performing trials, while others like Population Based Training (PBT) will make under-performing trials copy the hyperparameter config and model weights.\n\nTo speed up the process, Ray Tune adaptively buffers results so that trial training can be continued earlier if many trials are running in parallel and report many results at the same time. However, processing hundreds of results per trial for dozens or hundreds of trials can become a bottleneck.",

Move the data loader to the training function: The warning suggests that the actor TrainTrainable is very large. Check if its definition is implicitly capturing a large array or object in scope. To resolve this, move the data loader to the training function and make sure that the actor is not capturing any large objects implicitly. You can use ray.put() to put large objects in the Ray object store.\n\n2. Override the memory quota when creating the actor: You can specify the memory quota for the actor when creating it. For example, you can use the options() method to set the memory quota to 1GiB (1000 * 1024 * 1024) when creating the actor. This can be done as follows: SomeActor.options(memory=1000 * 1024 * 1024).remote(a=1, b=2).\n\n3. Check the batch size: The warning message also mentions that to ensure full parallelization across an actor pool of size 4, the specified batch size should be at most 5. Make sure that the configured batch size for the operator is not larger than the recommended value. In the provided context, the configured batch size is 16, which exceeds the recommended value.\n\n4. Use native types or Actors: To avoid serialization issues, try using only native types such as numpy arrays or lists/dicts of numpy arrays and other primitive types. Alternatively, you can use Actors to hold objects that cannot be serialized.\n\n5. Limit the number of running actors: Note that the number of running actors limits the number of concurrently running actor tasks. Make sure that the number of running actors is not exceeding the limit.\n\n6. Set memory quota dynamically: You can set the memory quota dynamically at runtime using the .options() method. For example, you can override the memory quota to 100MiB (100 * 1024 * 1024) when submitting the task. This can be done as follows: some_function.options(memory=100 * 1024 * 1024).remote(x=1).\n\n7.

            "generated_answer": "To use `ray.put()` and `ray.get()`, you need to have the Ray Client set up. Here are the steps to use them:\n\n1. Import the `ray` module: `import ray`\n\n2. Initialize your Ray cluster using `ray.init()`. You can pass an address to connect to an existing cluster if needed.\n\n3. Use the `@ray.remote` decorator to transform functions into tasks and classes into actors. This allows you to execute code on the cluster.\n\n4. Use `ray.put()` to transfer values into Ray's object store. This is useful for large objects that need to be accessed by remote functions or classes. By using `ray.put()`, you can pass object references as arguments to the remote functions or classes.\n\n5. Use `ray.get()` to retrieve objects from the object store. This is a blocking operation, so it should be called as late as possible to avoid hurting parallelism. Only call `ray.get()` at the end to get the final result.\n\nHere is an example of using these methods:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\ndef my_function(x):\n    return x * 2\n\n# Put a value into Ray's object store\nvalue = ray.put(42)\n\n# Call the remote function and pass the object reference as an argument\nresult = my_function.remote(value)\n\n# Get the result from the object store\nfinal_result = ray.get(result)\n\nprint(final_result)  # Output: 84\n```\n\nRemember that these are just the basic steps to use `ray.put()` and `ray.get()`. The Ray API consists of more than just these two methods, but they are powerful if you're just starting out.",
            "reference_answer": "To use ray.put and ray.get in Python, you first import the ray module. You can use ray.put() to store a value in the object store, which returns an object reference. You can then use ray.get() to fetch the result of a remote object from the object reference. If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the get call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory. Otherwise, the object data is deserialized into a Python object. You can also set a timeout to return early from a get that's blocking for too long.

For example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass GlobalVarActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.global_var = 3\n```\n\nThen, define another actor class that takes an instance of the `GlobalVarActor` as an argument in its `__init__` method. This allows the second actor to access the variable defined in the first actor. For example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self, global_var_actor):\n        self.global_var_actor = global_var_actor\n\n    def f(self):\n        return ray.get(self.global_var_actor.get_global_var.remote()) + 3\n```\n\nTo set the value of the global variable, you can use the `set_global_var` method of the `GlobalVarActor` class. For example:\n\n```python\nglobal_var_actor = GlobalVarActor.remote()\nactor = Actor.remote(global_var_actor)\nray.get(global_var_actor.set_global_var.remote(4))\n```\n\nNow, you can call the `f` method of the `Actor` class to get the updated value of the global variable. For example:\n\n```python\nassert ray.get(actor.f.remote()) == 7\n```\n\nBy following this approach, the variable defined in the `__init__` method of the `GlobalVarActor` class can be pickled and accessed by other actors.",

Each `Worker` instance has a buffer that contains a `cupy` array. The `compute` method of the `Worker` class performs the `all_reduce` operation on the buffer using the `col.allreduce` API.

The `--address` argument allows you to specify the remote Ray cluster's dashboard agent address.\n\nHere is an example command:\n\n```\nserve deploy config.yaml --address <remote dashboard agent address>\n```\n\nThe `<remote dashboard agent address>` should be in the format `[RAY_CLUSTER_URI]:[DASHBOARD_AGENT_PORT]`. For example, if the address for the local cluster started by `ray start --head` is `http://127.0.0.1:52365`, you can deploy to this address using the command:\n\n```\nserve deploy config_file.yaml -a http://127.0.0.1:52365\n```\n\nNote that the default port for the Ray Dashboard agent is 52365. If you want to set a different port, you can use the `--dashboard-agent-listen-port` argument when starting Ray.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `serve run` command with the `--address` argument to connect to the remote cluster via Ray Client, upload the project files, and run your Serve application. Here is an example command:\n\n```\nserve run --address=ray://<head-node-ip-address>:10001 --working-dir=\"./project/src\" local_dev:graph\n```\n\nIn this command, the `--working-dir` argument specifies the local directory containing the project files that will be uploaded to the cluster. Make sure that the directory contains the necessary files, such as `local_dev.py`, which will be imported by Ray Serve.\n\nOnce your application is up and running on the remote cluster, you can send requests to it using the appropriate address.\n\nRemember that by default, the Serve CLI assumes that you're working with a local cluster. However, if the `RAY_AGENT_ADDRESS` environment variable is set, the Serve CLI commands will use that value instead.\n\nTo test your application on a remote cluster, you can use the `serve run` command again, but this time pass the `--address` argument to specify the address of the Ray cluster to connect to. The address for remote clusters has the form `ray://<head-node-ip-address>:10001`.\n\nMake sure to check the Ray Dashboard to verify that it is running and accessible in your local browser.

Fix the resource quantity: Use the `ray.init(num_cpus=...)` function to specify the number of CPUs to be used during testing. This helps in controlling the resources and ensures consistent results.\n\n2. Share the Ray cluster across tests: If possible, reuse the Ray cluster across multiple tests. This can save time and resources by avoiding the overhead of creating a new cluster for each test.\n\n3. Create a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster`: If sharing the cluster is not feasible, you can create a mini-cluster specifically for testing purposes using the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class. This allows you to have more control over the cluster configuration and setup.\n\n4. Be cautious when running tests in parallel: Since Ray programs are parallel by nature, running tests in parallel can introduce unexpected behavior. Make sure to carefully design and structure your tests to avoid any interference or race conditions.\n\nAdditionally, make sure to import the `ray` module in your test files to access the necessary functionalities provided by Ray.\n\nNote: The provided context does not contain specific examples or code snippets for writing unit tests for Ray code.",

Calling `ray.get()` in a loop is a blocking operation that waits until the requested result is available, which can harm parallelism.

There is also an example of an anti-pattern where calling `ray.get()` without instantiating the receive side call will cause the code to hang.\n\nTo debug the hanging `ray.get()` call, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if you are calling `ray.get()` in a loop. If so, refactor your code to call `ray.get()` only for the final result.\n2. Make sure that you have instantiated the receive side call properly. If the receive side call is not properly instantiated, it can cause the code to hang.\n3. Review the code and ensure that you are not calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily for intermediate steps.

            "generated_answer": "To debug the issue of nodes being in a \"pending\" state for a long time when starting a cluster with Ray up, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the logs for any routing issues. Look for error messages like \"This node has an IP address of xx.xx.xx.xx, while we cannot find the matched Raylet address.\" This can occur if you connect the Ray cluster with a different IP address or connect a container. Overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections can also cause this issue. The solution is to start the worker nodes more slowly.\n\n2. If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, use the command `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` to check for errors. Ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough. In production scenarios, it is recommended to use larger Ray pods and size each Ray pod to take up an entire Kubernetes node.\n\n3. Use the command `ray status` to view detailed cluster status. This can help you identify any issues or errors.\n\n4. If the issue persists after waiting for 1 minute, check the logs for the dashboard and dashboard agent. The logs can be found at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/` on the head Pod.\n\n5. If you are running multiple clusters, consider starting a new Ray cluster instead of one large cluster. Running multiple smaller clusters can be more cost-effective and easier to debug.\n\n6. For running large Ray clusters with more than 1k nodes, you may need to tune system settings to enable communication between such a large number of machines. Refer to the configuration guide for more details.\n\n7. Use the command `watch -n 1 kubectl get pod` to continuously monitor the status of the pods.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and debug the issue with the pending nodes in your Ray cluster.",
            "reference_answer": "You can debug this by checking the autoscaling status and resource demands in the Jobs view. The autoscaling status will show you the pending, active, and failed nodes. The resource demands panel will show you resources that cannot be scheduled to the Cluster at the moment.

Set a seed for any shuffling operations: You can use the `seed` argument in functions like `random_shuffle()`, `randomize_block_order()`, or `iter_batches()` to ensure reproducibility.\n\n2. Use a small batch size: When calling `ds.map_batches()`, make sure to use a batch size that is small enough for the output batch to comfortably fit into memory. This helps avoid potential out-of-memory situations.\n\n3. Consider using `map_batches()` instead of unvectorized transformations: According to the warning message, the `map`, `flat_map`, and `filter` operations can be slow. If you're using a vectorized transformation, it is recommended to use `.map_batches()` instead.\n\n4. Repartition the dataset: Before mapping batches, you can repartition the dataset into multiple partitions. This ensures that there are enough parallel tasks to take advantage of all available resources. The example mentions using 100 partitions, but you can choose any other number as long as it is more than the number of available resources (e.g., GPUs).\n\n5. Follow best practices for enabling reproducibility: If reproducibility is important for your training framework, make sure to follow the best practices specific to your framework. For example, you can refer to the PyTorch reproducibility guide.\n\nNote that shuffling data can be important for model quality, so consider the trade-off between shuffling and reproducibility based on your specific use case.",

            "generated_answer": "When using KubeRay autoscaling, the Ray Autoscaler has more fine-grained control over scale-down compared to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. It can select precisely which pods to scale down and then delete those pods. This is important for Ray applications because downscaling a random pod could be dangerous. It is recommended to configure the RayCluster so that only one Ray pod fits per Kubernetes node. This way, Ray Autoscaler pod scaling events will correspond roughly one-to-one with cluster autoscaler node scaling events. The Ray Autoscaler and the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler complement each other. After the Ray Autoscaler decides to create or delete a Ray pod, the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can provision or clean up the corresponding Kubernetes node.",
            "reference_answer": "The GCS does not directly determine which Kubernetes pod to kill when using KubeRay autoscaling. Instead, the Ray autoscaler, a Ray cluster process, automatically scales a cluster up and down based on resource demand. It adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. The autoscaler also removes nodes after they become idle for some time. A node is considered idle if it has no active tasks, actors, or objects.",

You can use the same command mentioned above to access the pod and then check the logs under `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`.\n\nIt's important to note that Ray does not provide a native storage solution for log data, so users need to manage the lifecycle of the logs themselves.",

Bottlenecked by object store memory: Adding more CPU-only nodes to the cluster increases total cluster object store memory, allowing more data to be buffered between preprocessing and training stages.\n\n2. Insufficient bandwidth on the head node: The head node may experience high CPU usage due to outbound bandwidth limitations. It is recommended to ensure that the head node has sufficient bandwidth, especially for large clusters.\n\n3. High latency and low throughput for requests: Performance issues such as high latency and low throughput may cause spikes in CPU utilization. Monitoring with Ray and Ray Serve can help identify these issues, which may appear as constant serve_num_router_requests and spiking serve_deployment_processing_latency_ms. Using the right hardware and resources is important to address these issues.\n\n4. Bottlenecked by preprocessing compute time: If the bottleneck is preprocessing compute time, adding more CPU-only nodes with additional CPU cores can parallelize preprocessing and improve performance. If preprocessing is still not fast enough to saturate GPUs, adding enough CPU-only nodes to cache the preprocessed dataset can help.\n\n5. Insufficient computing resources in the Kubernetes cluster: If the Kubernetes cluster does not have enough computing resources, the GKE Autopilot may add a new Kubernetes node to the cluster. This process may take a few minutes, causing some Pods to be pending and potentially impacting CPU utilization.\n\n6. Linux Out of Memory killer or Ray Memory Monitor: Processes with high memory usage may be killed by the Linux Out of Memory killer or Ray Memory Monitor to avoid out-of-memory situations. Additionally, system instability or overload can lead to CPU spikes and failures.\n\nIt is also mentioned that the choice of CPU type and the number of CPUs/GPUs should be considered based on the specific requirements of the application.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

Increase the capacity of the object store: Objects are spilled to external storage when the capacity of the object store is used up. By increasing the capacity, you can reduce the likelihood of objects getting spilled.\n\n2. Optimize memory usage: Minimize the memory usage of your distributed applications to avoid filling up the object store prematurely. This can be achieved by avoiding multiple copies of the same object in the object store.\n\n3. Use high-performance storage: If possible, use NVMe SSDs or other high-performance storage options. This can help improve the performance of object spilling if it becomes necessary.\n\n4. Monitor and analyze object spilling: Ray provides stats and logs related to object spilling. You can monitor the raylet logs to see when spilling is happening and view cluster-wide spill stats using the \"ray memory\" command. This can help you understand the impact of object spilling on your application's performance.\n\nBy implementing these measures, you can minimize the occurrence of object spilling and optimize the performance of your distributed applications.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",
