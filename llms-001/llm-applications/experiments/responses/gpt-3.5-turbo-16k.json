            "answer": "When using Ray Data's `map_batches` method, you can configure the batch type by specifying the `batch_format`. By default, Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays. However, you can also configure it to represent batches as pandas DataFrames.\n\nTo convert the batch type, you can define a function that takes a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays as input and returns a dictionary of the desired batch format. For example, if you want to increase the brightness of an image batch, you can define a function like this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n```\n\nThen, you can use this function with `map_batches` to transform the batches:\n\n```python\nds.map_batches(increase_brightness)\n```\n\nIt's important to note that using a large batch size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, make sure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and always call `map_batches` with a batch size small enough so that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\n\nAdditionally, you can refer to the Ray Data documentation for more information on configuring batch formats and using the `map_batches` method."

            "answer": "In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the deployment's load. The Ray Serve Autoscaler, which is an application-level autoscaler, interacts with the Ray Autoscaler to manage the scaling process.\n\nWhen the demand for resources exceeds the current capacity of the cluster, the Ray Autoscaler tries to increase the number of worker nodes. Conversely, when worker nodes are idle, the autoscaler removes them from the cluster. It's important to note that the autoscaler responds to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization.\n\nTo configure autoscaling in Ray, you can use the Ray cluster launcher or configure it on Kubernetes using the Ray autoscaler. The autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes or pods in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.\n\nIn the context of Ray Serve Autoscaling, you can start your deployment with a minimum number of replicas set to 0. The scale-up process will be triggered when traffic is sent to the deployment. However, there will be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the request.\n\nIt's worth noting that while autoscaling can reduce workload costs, it also adds node launch overheads and can be challenging to configure. If you're new to Ray, it's recommended to start with non-autoscaling clusters."

You can then extract the IP address of the desired node from the output.\n\nAlternatively, if you already know the IP address of the head node or the Ray cluster, you can use the `redis_address` attribute of the head node to get the address.

If a concrete address (e.g., `localhost:<port>`) is provided, Ray will try to connect to it. Concrete addresses can be prefixed with \"ray://\" to connect to a remote cluster. For example, passing in the address \"ray://123.45.67.89:50005\" will connect to the cluster at the given address. If no address is provided, Ray will try to find an existing Ray instance to connect to. This is done by first checking the environment variable `RAY_ADDRESS`.

One reason is that tasks or actors may use more than their proportionate share of memory, which can lead to issues like Out of Memory (OOM) errors. In such cases, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them. Ray ensures that the sum of the resource requirements of all concurrently running tasks and actors on a node does not exceed the node's total resources.\n\nAnother reason is that the resource requirements of tasks or actors do not impose limits on actual physical resource usage. For example, Ray does not prevent a task with a resource requirement of num_cpus=1 from launching multiple threads and using multiple physical CPUs. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that tasks or actors do not use more resources than specified via resource requirements. Ray does not provide CPU isolation for tasks or actors and does not reserve a physical CPU exclusively for a task with num_cpus=1.\n\nIn certain use cases, running too many tasks can cause OOM issues. To address this, the memory resource can be used to limit the number of concurrently running tasks. It is important to note that the memory resource requirement is logical, meaning that Ray will not enforce the physical memory usage of each task if it exceeds this amount.\n\nOverall, Ray does not provide strong resource isolation, priorities, or access control. The resources in Ray are logical and do not limit the physical resources a task or actor can use while running. This lack of strong resource isolation can lead to interference between simultaneous jobs and make them less reliable to run in production."

            "answer": "You should use Ray Client when you want to connect an interactive Python shell to a remote Ray cluster. It allows you to leverage a remote Ray cluster just like you would with Ray running on your local machine. By changing `ray.init()` to `ray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:<port>\")`, you can connect from your laptop or anywhere else directly to a remote cluster and scale-out your Ray code while maintaining the ability to develop interactively in a Python shell.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to consider. Ray Client requires a stable connection to the remote cluster and will terminate the workload if the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds. It is not recommended for long-running workloads, in which case Ray Jobs API should be used instead.\n\nTo use Ray Client, the address passed into `ray.init` should be prefixed with `ray://`. Additionally, you can provide two optional arguments: `namespace` to set the namespace for the session, and `runtime_env` to specify the runtime environment for the session.\n\nIt is recommended to start a separate Ray cluster for each user to isolate their workloads. Ray Client is not supported by the new engine, so it's important to ensure compatibility between the Ray version running on the cluster and the Ray version used by the client.\n\nFor more information and advanced topics on using Ray, you can refer to the official Ray documentation."

            "answer": "Ray Serve offers several advantages over other model serving frameworks like Modal or Seldon. Here are some reasons why you might choose Ray Serve:\n\n1. Ease of development and deployment: Ray Serve allows you to develop your models on your laptop and easily deploy them on a development box. You can then scale them out to multiple machines or a Kubernetes cluster with minimal or no changes to your code. This makes it easier to get started without the need to provision and manage a Kubernetes cluster. Ray Serve also provides a Kubernetes Operator that allows you to deploy your Ray Serve application to Kubernetes transparently.\n\n2. Programmable API for multi-model composition: Ray Serve supports multi-model composition using a programmable API. This means that calls to different models can be made using function calls, making it easier to work with and write code. The models can use different resources and run across different machines in the cluster, but you can write the code like a regular program.\n\n3. Framework-agnostic: Ray Serve is not tied to any specific machine learning library or framework. It provides a general-purpose scalable serving layer that can be used with various frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, and even arbitrary Python business logic. This flexibility allows you to avoid being locked into a specific framework and adapt to the fast-paced nature of machine learning.\n\n4. Scalability and reliability: Ray Serve brings the scalability and reliability of hosted offerings to your own infrastructure. You can use the Ray cluster launcher to deploy Ray Serve to major public clouds, Kubernetes, as well as on bare-metal or on-premise machines. This allows you to scale your serving infrastructure as needed and avoid being limited to a single cloud provider.\n\n5. Integration with business logic: Ray Serve provides key features for building production-ready machine learning applications, including autoscaling and integration with business logic. It is not just focused on serving and scaling models independently but also on model composition and building ML applications that naturally integrate with your business logic.\n\nIn summary, Ray Serve offers a scalable and programmable serving layer that is framework-agnostic, easy to develop and deploy, and provides integration with business logic. It allows you to build production-ready machine learning applications with flexibility and scalability."

This class or function will handle incoming requests and can be scaled up to run across a Ray cluster. You can also define multiple replicas of the deployment to handle the request load.\n\n2. Configure your deployment: Ray Serve allows you to configure your deployments by increasing the number of replicas or assigning resources such as CPUs and GPUs to each replica. This can be done using the Ray Serve CLI.\n\n3. Deploy using the CLI: You can deploy your Ray Serve application to production on a Ray cluster using the Ray Serve CLI. The `serve deploy` command takes in a config file path and deploys it to a Ray cluster over HTTP. This can be a local, single-node cluster or a remote, multi-node cluster started with the Ray Cluster Launcher.\n\n4. Production deployment: For running Ray Serve in production, it is recommended to use Kubernetes with the KubeRay RayService custom resource. This handles important production requirements such as health checking, status reporting, failure recovery, and upgrades. If you're not using Kubernetes, you can run Ray Serve on a Ray cluster directly using the Serve CLI.\n\n5. Autoscaling: Ray Serve provides an autoscaling feature that automatically adjusts the number of replicas based on the deployment's load. This ensures efficient resource utilization and can be enabled for your LLM workload.\n\nBy following these steps, you can rapidly prototype, develop, and deploy scalable LLM applications using Ray Serve."

You can customize other parameters of the `SyncConfig` object according to your needs.\n\nNote that Ray AIR defaults to using pyarrow for syncing with the specified cloud storage path. If you want to implement custom logic for uploading/downloading from the cloud, you can pass a custom `Syncer` object to the `SyncConfig` within the `air.RunConfig`.\n\nFor more details and examples of custom syncing, you can refer to the documentation on \"How can I upload my Tune results to cloud storage?\" and \"How can I use the awscli or gsutil command line commands for syncing?\".\n\nPlease note that the functionality of syncing to the head node will be hard-deprecated in Ray 2.7."

            ],
            "answer": "To quickly narrow down the root cause of a failed Ray job, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Access the job logs: Ray applications are typically run as Ray Jobs, and the worker logs of Ray Jobs are always captured in the Ray logging directory. However, driver logs are only captured for Ray Jobs submitted via the Jobs API. You can find the captured driver logs using the Dashboard UI, CLI (using the `ray job logs` command), or the Python SDK (`JobSubmissionClient.get_logs()` or `JobSubmissionClient.tail_job_logs()`).\n\n2. View driver logs: If you run Ray Jobs by executing the Ray Driver on the Head node directly or connecting via Ray Client, the driver logs may not be accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, you can check the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output to view the driver logs.\n\n3. Check task and actor logs: Task and actor logs, also known as worker logs, are accessible from the Task and Actor table view. Click the \"Log\" button to see the stdout and stderr logs that contain the output emitted from tasks and actors. For actors, you can also see the system logs for the corresponding worker process.\n\n4. Use the `ray logs` command: You can use the `ray logs` command to get logs based on the filename (cluster) or resource identifiers (actor). For example, to see the logs of a worker, you can use `ray logs worker-6f2ec5c8b0d5f5a66572859faf192d36743536c2e9702ea58084b037*out -ip 10.0.62.231.`\n\n5. Utilize the Logs view: The Logs view in the Dashboard lists the Ray logs in your cluster, organized by node and log file name. It provides search functionality to help you find specific log messages. If the Ray Job is submitted by the Job API, the Job logs are available from the Dashboard, following the format: `job-driver-<job_submission_id>.log`.\n\n6. Check full logs: Full logs can be found in the file `runtime_env_setup-[job_id].log` for per-actor, per-task, and per-job environments. When using Ray Client, you can find them in `runtime_env_setup-ray_client_server_[port].log` for per-job environments. You can enable runtime_env debugging log streaming by setting the environment variable `RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_LOG_TO_DRIVER_ENABLED=1` on each node before starting Ray.\n\n7. Log Persistence: Ray does not provide a native storage solution for log data, so you need to manage the lifecycle of the logs yourself. You can collect logs from Ray Clusters running on VMs by accessing files such as `dashboard.[log|err]`, `dashboard_agent.log`, and `gcs_server.[out|err]`.\n\nBy following these steps and analyzing the logs, you should be able to narrow down the root cause of a failed Ray job."

            "answer": "The additional context suggests that the worker node is dying due to memory pressure (OOM - Out of Memory). Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:\n\n1. Check the logs: Use the command `ray logs raylet.out -ip 172.31.183.172` to see more information about the workers killed on the node with IP 172.31.183.172. This can provide insights into the specific error messages or warnings leading to the worker's termination.\n\n2. Increase the number of workers: As mentioned in the warning message, consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument in the `DataLoader` initialization. The warning suggests trying a value of 64, which is the number of CPUs on the machine. Increasing the number of workers can help distribute the workload and alleviate memory pressure.\n\n3. Reduce memory consumption: Adjust the settings to reduce memory consumption. The warning messages indicate that there is high memory pressure, and frequent cache flushes are detrimental to performance. Consider optimizing your code or model to reduce memory usage. You can also try adding `get_accelerator().empty_cache()` calls in your training loop to ensure that all ranks flush their caches at the same time.\n\n4. Check system logs: Use the `dmesg` command-line interface (CLI) command to verify if the processes are being killed by the Linux out-of-memory killer. This can provide additional information about the system-level memory pressure.\n\n5. Retry failed workers: If Ray's memory monitor kills a worker, it is automatically retried. However, if tasks or actors cannot be retried, they raise an exception with a cleaner error message when you call `ray.get()` on them. Make sure your code handles these exceptions appropriately.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the cause of the worker node failures and take appropriate actions to resolve the issue."

To tolerate head node failures, the Global Control Store (GCS) needs to be made fault tolerant so that when a new head node is started, all the cluster-level data is still available.\n\n2. Raylet failure: When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated the same as a node failure. Even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node in the cluster.\n\n3. Worker node failure: If a worker node fails, the actors running on it also fail. The system detects the failure and attempts to respawn the actors on the remaining healthy nodes. KubeRay also tries to restart the worker pod on another running node and brings up a new healthy node to replace the failed one.\n\n4. Temporary directory cleanup: When machines reboot, temporary directories are often cleared up, which can result in the loss of log files. To inspect logs after clusters are stopped or terminated, it is necessary to store and persist the logs.\n\nIt is important to note that killing a node and waiting for it to recover usually takes longer than killing a pod and waiting for it to recover. Simulating failures by killing at the pod level is quicker for debugging purposes."

Batch: A batch, in the context of model training, refers to the number of data points used to compute and apply one gradient update to the model weights. In Ray Data, batches are represented as NumPy arrays or pandas DataFrames. The batch size can be configured by specifying the \"batch_format\" parameter. Batches can be inspected using the `take_batch()` method, which returns a batch of data from multiple rows.\n\nIn summary, a block is an internal unit of data processing in Ray datasets, while a batch is a user-facing object used for model training and inference."

The `rayproject/examples` image adds additional libraries for running examples. You can review the available images by listing them using the command `docker images`.\n\n4. Another way to set up dependencies is to prepare a single environment across the cluster before starting the Ray runtime. This can be done using the Ray Cluster Launcher. You can find more information on how to prepare the environment using the Ray Cluster Launcher in the documentation.\n\n5. If you prefer to install dependencies dynamically while Ray is running, you can use Ray's runtime environments. A runtime environment describes the dependencies your Ray application needs to run, including files, packages, environment variables, and more. It is installed dynamically on the cluster at runtime and cached for future use. Runtime environments can be used on top of the prepared environment from the Ray Cluster Launcher if it was used. You can refer to the User Guide for more information on environment dependencies.\n\n6. Lastly, you can check the Configuration documentation for various ways to configure Ray.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up your development environment for the Ray project."

Check the log messages: Look for any error messages or warnings that might indicate the cause of the deadlock. The log messages can provide valuable information about the state of the workers and any potential issues.\n\n2. Review the source code: Examine the source code of `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py` to understand how the rollout workers are implemented. Pay attention to any synchronization mechanisms or potential points of contention that could lead to deadlocks.\n\n3. Enable debugging tools: Ray provides various debugging tools that can help identify and diagnose deadlocks. For example, you can enable logging and set the log level to a more detailed level to get more information about the execution flow. You can also use Ray's dashboard to monitor the status of the workers and identify any potential bottlenecks.\n\n4. Reproduce the issue: Try to reproduce the deadlock issue in a controlled environment. This can help isolate the problem and make it easier to debug. You can create a minimal example that reproduces the deadlock and use it for testing and debugging purposes.\n\n5. Use debugging techniques: Once you have identified the potential cause of the deadlock, you can use standard debugging techniques to investigate further. For example, you can use breakpoints, print statements, or logging statements to track the execution flow and identify the point at which the deadlock occurs.\n\n6. Analyze the data flow: Analyze the data flow between the different components involved in the rollout workers. Check if there are any data dependencies or race conditions that could lead to deadlocks. Make sure that the data is being properly synchronized and shared between the workers.\n\n7. Consult the Ray documentation and community: If you are still unable to identify the cause of the deadlock, you can consult the Ray documentation or reach out to the Ray community for assistance. They may be able to provide additional insights or suggest specific debugging techniques for your particular scenario."

For example, you can use `ray.get(object_ref)` to retrieve the value associated with the object reference.\n\nAnother option is to use the `await` keyword with the object reference. If you are working in an async context, you can use `await object_ref` to wait for the result to be available without retrieving it. For a list of object references, you can use `await asyncio.gather(*object_refs)`.\n\nIt's important to note that mixing synchronous and asynchronous calls is possible but using async APIs is recommended to increase concurrency.\n\nPlease note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the context in which you are working."

Each replica maps to a Ray actor at runtime, and requests to a deployment are load balanced across its replicas.\n\nDeployments are the central concept in Ray Serve. They contain business logic or an ML model to handle incoming requests and can be scaled up to run across a Ray cluster. At runtime, a deployment consists of multiple replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down to match the incoming request load. To define a deployment, the @serve.deployment decorator is used on a Python class or function.\n\nRay Serve allows configuring deployments to scale out by increasing the number of replicas and assigning replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs.\n\nTo set up basic serving with Ray Serve, a callable class is defined as the Serve deployment. The deployment consists of multiple replicas, which are separate copies of the class or function started in separate Ray Actors. The number of replicas can be scaled up or down to match the request load.\n\nIn Ray Serve 2.0, a new deployment API was released, but the 1.x deployment API can still be used (although it will be deprecated in the future version).\n\nOverall, deployments in Ray Serve provide a way to handle incoming requests and can be scaled and configured to meet the application's needs."

It tries to allocate all the bundles onto a single node, but if strict packing is not feasible (i.e., some bundles do not fit on the node), it can allocate bundles onto other nodes.\n\n2. SPREAD Strategy: This strategy places bundles across distinct nodes as evenly as possible. It tries to spread the bundles among available nodes, allocating each bundle to a separate node on a best-effort basis.\n\nIn summary, the PACK strategy aims to minimize the number of nodes used by packing bundles together, while the SPREAD strategy aims to evenly distribute the bundles across multiple nodes."

If you need to configure Ray when running a Java application in single machine mode, you can start the Ray cluster first by running `ray start`.\n\n4. There are three ways to start the Ray runtime:\n   - Implicitly via `ray.init()` (Starting Ray on a single machine)\n   - Explicitly via CLI (Starting Ray via the CLI command `ray start`)\n   - Explicitly via the cluster launcher (Launching a Ray cluster using `ray up`)\n\n5. While ad-hoc execution on the Ray cluster can be done, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs to execute applications on a Ray cluster.\n\n6. Ray can be used on Cloud VMs, such as using `ray_LSF` for running Ray with LSF. This allows users to start a Ray cluster on LSF and run DL workloads either in batch or interactive mode.\n\n7. For highly parallelizable tasks, Ray can be used to distribute the workload across multiple machines. By leveraging Ray's parallelization capabilities, tasks that would take a long time on a single machine can be completed much faster by utilizing multiple machines with multiple cores.\n\nOverall, the best way to run Ray across multiple machines is to start a Ray cluster for each user and utilize Ray's runtime and parallelization capabilities."

            "answer": "To utilize the 'zero-copy' feature provided by Ray for numpy arrays, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. When using Ray tasks, make sure to use the `ray.get()` function to retrieve the result of the task. For example:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       ray.get(f.remote(np.zeros(100)))\n   except ray.exceptions.RayTaskError as e:\n       print(e)\n   ```\n\n2. If you need to mutate the array received from a Ray task, you can manually copy the array at the destination using the `arr.copy()` method. This effectively disables the zero-copy deserialization feature provided by Ray. For example:\n   ```python\n   arr = arr.copy()\n   ```\n\n3. By default, Ray optimizes for numpy arrays by using Pickle protocol 5 with out-of-band data. The numpy array is stored as a read-only object, and all Ray workers on the same node can read the numpy array in the object store without copying (zero-copy reads). However, any writes to the read-only object will require you to first copy it into the local process memory.\n\n4. If your function does not mutate its input, you can set `zero_copy_batch=True` to improve performance and decrease memory utilization. This can be done when calling the `map_batches()` function. For example:\n   ```python\n   ds.map_batches(add_dog_years, zero_copy_batch=True)\n   ```\n\nRemember that if you need to mutate the input batch, you should not set `zero_copy_batch=True`, as it provides a read-only view of the data."

This makes it easier to share and modify state across different parts of your application.\n\n2. Resource Flexibility: Actors can be scheduled on different workers, including CPU, GPU, and custom resources. This allows you to leverage the available resources efficiently based on the actor's requirements.\n\n3. Fault Tolerance: Actors can handle failures gracefully. If an actor process dies or the owner of the actor dies, the actor can be recreated and continue its execution from the last known state.\n\nDisadvantages of using a singleton actor include:\n\n1. Limited Concurrency: Singleton actors are limited to a single instance, which means they can only handle one request at a time. This can lead to performance bottlenecks if there are multiple concurrent requests.\n\n2. Synchronous Execution: By default, actor methods are executed synchronously, which means that each method call will block until it completes. This can impact the overall responsiveness of your application if there are long-running tasks.\n\n3. Complexity: Working with actors introduces additional complexity compared to traditional programming models. Understanding actor lifetimes, fault tolerance mechanisms, and resource management can require a learning curve.\n\nIt's important to consider these advantages and disadvantages when deciding whether to use a singleton actor in your application."

Here's an example:\n\n```python\nclass MyBatchMapper(ray.data.preprocessor.Preprocessor):\n    def map_batches(self, batch):\n        # Perform operations on the batch and return the modified batch\n        return modified_batch\n\n# Assuming you have a ray.data.Dataset object called dataset\nresult_dataset = dataset.map_batches(MyBatchMapper())\n```\n\nIn both cases, the `map_batches` method takes care of applying the provided function or UDF to each batch in the dataset. The resulting dataset, `result_dataset`, will contain the modified batches returned by the map function."

            "answer": "To set a maximum episode length when training with Rllib, you can use the `rollout_fragment_length` parameter. This parameter determines the number of steps in each fragment during rollouts. Trajectories of this size are collected from rollout workers and combined into a larger batch for learning.\n\nFor example, if you set `rollout_fragment_length` to 100 and `train_batch_size` to 1000, RLlib will collect 10 fragments of 100 steps each from rollout workers. These fragments will then be concatenated and used for training.\n\nKeep in mind that the maximum episode length will depend on various factors such as the `batch_mode` (truncate_episodes or complete_episodes), `replay_sequence_length`, and other settings. Additionally, if you choose `complete_episodes` as the `batch_mode` and your environment does not terminate easily, it could result in large batch sizes.\n\nHere's an example of how you can configure the `replay_buffer_config` to use episodes as the storage unit:\n\n```python\nconfig.training(replay_buffer_config={\"storage_unit\": StorageUnit.EPISODES})\n```\n\nNote that the `replay_sequence_length` and other parameters can be adjusted to further control the episode length."

This allows the trial to retry on failures.\n\nAdditionally, Ray Tune provides fault tolerance and recovery at the experiment trial level. If you enable periodic checkpointing, Ray Tune will save the state of the experiment to a user-specified persistent storage location. If a trial fails, Ray Tune will automatically restart it from the latest checkpointed state.\n\nYou can also define callbacks to handle trial recovery and trial errors. The `on_trial_recover` callback is called after a trial instance fails but is scheduled for retry, while the `on_trial_error` callback is called after a trial instance fails. These callbacks can be used to customize the behavior of retrying trials on failures.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Ray Tune documentation on fault tolerance and recovery."

The worker actors are managed by the supervisor actor, and their lifetimes can be decoupled from the job, allowing them to persist even after the driver process of the job exits.

            "answer": "In the given context, the object store is a distributed in-memory data store for storing Ray objects. When data is put into the object store using functions like `ray.put()`, it is stored in the object store. The object store is specific to each node, and data remains local to the writer until requested by another task or actor on another node.\n\nIn the provided example, a numpy array is created and stored in the object store using `ray.put()`. The array is then fetched from the object store and the corresponding ObjectRef is deleted. However, the object is still pinned in the object store because the deserialized copy points directly to the memory in the object store.\n\nThe object store memory is the memory used when your application creates objects in the object store via `ray.put()` and when it returns values from remote functions. Objects in the object store are reference counted and evicted when they fall out of scope.\n\nTo avoid repeatedly storing the same object into the object store, it is recommended to use `ray.put()` to store the object once and then pass the reference around. This helps avoid out-of-disk issues for the driver node.\n\nOverall, the object store is used to store Ray objects and allows for efficient sharing of large objects among actors and tasks."

            "answer": "To kill or cancel a Ray task that you have already started, you can use the `ray.cancel()` function. This function allows you to cancel a task based on certain conditions. \n\nIf the specified task is pending execution, it will not be executed. If the task is currently executing, the behavior depends on the `force` flag. When `force=False`, a `KeyboardInterrupt` will be raised in Python. When `force=True`, the executing task will immediately exit. \n\nIt's important to note that only non-actor tasks can be canceled. Canceled tasks will not be retried, and the `max_retries` parameter will not be respected. If the task is already finished, nothing will happen. \n\nTo cancel a task, you need to call `ray.cancel()` on the `ObjectRef` returned by the task. By default, this will send a `KeyboardInterrupt` to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. If you pass `force=True` to `ray.cancel()`, it will force-exit the worker. \n\nHere's an example of canceling a task:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `blocking_operation()` task is canceled using `ray.cancel(obj_ref)`. Then, when trying to retrieve the result using `ray.get(obj_ref)`, a `TaskCancelledError` will be raised."

To resolve this issue, you can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Move the data loader to the training function: The warning message suggests that the actor \"TrainTrainable\" is very large. Check if the data loader is defined within the actor's scope. If so, move the data loader outside the actor's scope and pass the necessary data as arguments to the training function.\n\n2. Use ray.put() to put large objects in the Ray object store: If you are using large arrays or objects within the actor's scope, consider using the `ray.put()` function to store them in the Ray object store. This can help reduce the size of the actor and avoid the \"actor is too large\" error.\n\n3. Increase the batch size: If you have access to large GPUs, you can increase the batch size to better utilize the GPU resources. This can help saturate the GPUs and potentially reduce the memory usage of the actor.\n\n4. Check for implicit capturing of large objects: Make sure that the actor's definition is not implicitly capturing a large array or object in its scope. This can happen if you are referencing a large object without explicitly passing it as an argument to the actor. Use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store and pass them as arguments to the actor instead.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"ValueError: The actor ImplicitFunc is too large\" issue."

            "answer": "To use `ray.put()` and `ray.get()` in Ray, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize your Ray cluster using `ray.init()`. This step is necessary to connect to the Ray cluster.\n\n2. Use `ray.put(value)` to store an object in Ray's distributed object store. This function takes the object you want to store as an argument and returns a reference to the object in the object store.\n\n3. To retrieve the object from the object store, you can use `ray.get(object_ref)`. This function takes the reference to the object in the object store as an argument and returns the actual value of the object.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate the usage:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Step 1: Initialize Ray cluster\nray.init()\n\n# Step 2: Store an object in the object store\nvalue = \"Hello, Ray!\"\nobject_ref = ray.put(value)\n\n# Step 3: Retrieve the object from the object store\nresult = ray.get(object_ref)\nprint(result)  # Output: Hello, Ray!\n```\n\nIn the example above, we first initialize the Ray cluster using `ray.init()`. Then, we store the string \"Hello, Ray!\" in the object store using `ray.put()`, which returns a reference to the object. Finally, we retrieve the object using `ray.get()` and print the result.\n\nNote that `ray.get()` can also be used to retrieve a list of remote objects from the object store by passing a list of object references as an argument.\n\nIt's important to note that `ray.put()` and `ray.get()` are used for storing and retrieving objects in Ray's object store, respectively. They are commonly used in conjunction with other Ray functionalities such as tasks and actors to build distributed applications."

Ray Data supports various data sources and formats, such as CSV files. Refer to the \"Loading Data\" section in the Ray Data user guide for more details.\n\n2. Define a Python class to load the pre-trained model if necessary.\n\n3. Transform your dataset using the pre-trained model by calling the `map_batches()` method on the dataset. This method applies a function to each batch of the dataset in parallel. Refer to the \"Transforming Data\" section in the user guide for more information.\n\n4. Iterate through the output or save the results to obtain the final predictions. You can use the `map()` method to apply a function to the entire dataset. Note that the `map()` method is lazy and won't execute until the results are consumed. Alternatively, you can use the `map_batches()` method for vectorized transformations, which can be more efficient. Refer to the \"Iterating over data\" and \"Saving data\" sections in the user guide for more details.\n\nBy leveraging Ray Data's distributed processing capabilities, you can utilize the full Ray cluster to speed up the preprocessing of your data. Additionally, Ray Data provides features like global shuffles and supports streaming execution for efficient processing of large datasets."

            "answer": "To pickle a variable defined in an actor's `__init__` method, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Use an actor's instance variables to hold the global state. This means defining the variable as an instance variable within the `__init__` method of the actor class.\n2. Pass the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed. This allows other methods or functions to access and modify the instance variable.\n3. When creating an actor instance, use the `.remote()` method on the actor class to create an actor handle. This handle can be used to call the actor's methods.\n4. To pickle the variable, you can directly serialize the actor handle using a serialization library like cloudpickle.\n\nHere's an example of how to create an actor and pickle its variable:\n\n```python\nimport cloudpickle\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.variable = 123\n\n# Create an actor handle\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\n\n# Pickle the actor handle\npickled_handle = cloudpickle.dumps(actor_handle)\n\n# Unpickle the actor handle\nunpickled_handle = cloudpickle.loads(pickled_handle)\n\n# Access the variable using the unpickled handle\nvariable_value = ray.get(unpickled_handle.variable)\nprint(variable_value)  # Output: 123\n```\n\nNote that using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported in Ray actors. Each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, so each actor will have its own copy of the instance variables."

In the `__init__` method, set up the necessary components, and in the `__call__` method, perform the data transformation.\n2. Create an `ActorPoolStrategy` and configure the number of concurrent workers. Each worker will transform a partition of the data.\n3. Call the `map_batches()` method and pass your `ActorPoolStrategy` to compute the transformation.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nimport ray\n\nclass TorchPredictor:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.model = torch.nn.Identity()\n        self.model.eval()\n\n# Create the actors\na1, a2 = Actor.remote(), Actor.remote()\npool = ActorPool([a1, a2])\n\n# Perform the all_reduce operation\nresult = list(pool.map(lambda a, v: a.double.remote(v), [1, 2, 3, 4]))\n\nprint(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ActorPool` class is used to manage the actors and distribute the computation. The `map()` method applies the `double.remote()` function to each value in the input list, and the result is collected and returned as a list.\n\nNote: The code snippet provided is a simplified example and may need to be adapted to your specific use case."

In the given context, the current cluster has a total of 2 CPUs and 2 GPUs.

However, we won't be able to schedule the second bundle because there are not enough available resources in the cluster.\n\nSince we cannot create every bundle on the cluster, the placement group is not created, including the `{\"CPU\": 1}` bundle. Placement groups are atomically created, which means if a bundle cannot fit in any of the current nodes, the entire placement group is not ready and no resources are reserved.\n\nIn summary, if we specify a bundle with `{\"CPU\":0}` in the PlacementGroup, it will not be created if there are not enough available resources in the cluster to satisfy the bundle's requirements."

For example, if the address for the remote cluster is `http://127.0.0.1:52365`, you can deploy to this address using the following command:\n\n```\nserve deploy config.yaml -a http://127.0.0.1:52365\n```\n\nMake sure that the import path is accessible when running on a remote cluster. You can refer to the \"Handle Dependencies\" section for instructions on how to add a runtime environment.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `serve run` command to run and test your application easily, either locally or on a remote cluster. For example, you can run the following command:\n\n```\nserve run config.yaml\n```\n\nThis will start a local Ray instance and deploy the application specified in the `config.yaml` file. You can view the Ray Dashboard in your local browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8265` to monitor the deployment.\n\nIf you want to deploy your Serve application to production on a Ray cluster, you can use the Ray Serve CLI. The recommended way to run Ray Serve in production is on Kubernetes using the KubeRay RayService custom resource. However, if you're not running on Kubernetes, you can still run Ray Serve on a Ray cluster directly using the Serve CLI. The \"Production Guide\" section provides more details on how to generate a Serve config file and deploy it using the Serve CLI."

            "answer": "In the given context, an `actor_handle` refers to a handle or reference to an actor in the Ray framework. An actor is a stateful object that can execute tasks concurrently and maintain its own internal state. The `actor_handle` allows you to interact with the actor by invoking its methods or accessing its state.\n\nThe `actor_handle` is created using the `ActorHandle` class, which encapsulates information about the actor, such as its language, ID, decorators, method signatures, and more. It is typically created using one of three methods: calling `.remote()` on an `ActorClass`, passing an actor handle into a task, or directly serializing the `ActorHandle` using a library like cloudpickle.\n\nYou can pass the `actor_handle` into other tasks or remote functions to interact with the actor. This allows you to invoke methods on the actor, access its state, or modify its internal variables. The `actor_handle` provides a way to communicate with and coordinate the execution of the actor.\n\nAdditionally, the `actor_handle` can be used to manage the lifecycle of the actor. For example, you can use the `Kill()` method on the `actor_handle` to terminate the actor. However, note that killing an actor directly may bypass the normal teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed within the actor may not be called.\n\nOverall, the `actor_handle` is a crucial component in working with actors in the Ray framework, allowing you to interact with and control the behavior of the actor."

            "answer": "To kill a detached actor in Ray, you can use the `ray.kill(actor)` function. This will immediately interrupt any running tasks on the actor, causing them to fail. Note that `atexit` handlers installed in the actor will not be run in this case. If you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead to queue a termination task. Any `atexit` handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nHere is an example of how to kill a detached actor:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\n\nAfter calling `ray.kill(actor_handle)`, subsequent calls to get the actor's handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail.\n\nIt's worth noting that killing actors should generally be reserved for cases where an actor is unexpectedly hanging or leaking resources, or for detached actors that must be manually destroyed. Actors are automatically garbage-collected by Ray, so manual termination is usually not necessary."

For better performance, you can try iterating over batches with shuffling. Additionally, you can set the `seed` parameter to ensure reproducibility of the shuffle.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Ray Data shuffles data blocks in a map-reduce style. Map tasks partition blocks by value, and then reduce tasks merge co-partitioned blocks. Shuffles materialize datasets in memory, meaning shuffle execution isn't streamed through memory.\n\nIf you want to try out the push-based shuffle implementation, you can set the environment variable `RAY_DATA_PUSH_BASED_SHUFFLE=1` when running your application. This will enable the experimental push-based shuffle feature.\n\nFor more information on shuffle performance and optimization, you can refer to the \"Performance Tips and Tuning\" guide."

            "answer": "Ray works with asyncio by natively integrating with it. This allows you to use Ray alongside popular async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. When using Ray with asyncio, you can define async actors that can run multiple invocations of their methods concurrently in the event loop. For example, you can define an async actor using the `@ray.remote` decorator and async method definitions. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2)  # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n```\n\nTo invoke the async method of the actor, you can use `actor.run_concurrent.remote()`. If you want to run multiple invocations of the method concurrently, you can use a list comprehension like this:\n\n```python\nray.get([actor.run_concurrent.remote() for _ in range(5)])\n```\n\nThis will start all 5 tasks at once, and after 2 seconds, they should all finish. Note that in async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time, although tasks can be multiplexed.\n\nIt's important to note that running blocking `ray.get` or `ray.wait` inside async actor methods is not allowed because it will block the execution of the event loop. If you need to use `ray.get` asynchronously, you can wrap it in an async function and use `asyncio.run` to execute it."

Avoid calling `ray.get()` in a loop, as it is a blocking call that waits until the requested result is available. Calling it in a loop will prevent the loop from continuing until the call is resolved.\n\n2. Separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. This allows all remote functions to be spawned before waiting for the results, enabling parallel execution.\n\n3. Instead of calling `ray.get()` one by one, pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` to wait for all tasks to finish.\n\n4. Consider delaying the call to `ray.get()` as long as possible or even designing your program to avoid calling it altogether. Only call `ray.get()` when you need the final result.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can improve the parallelism and performance of your Ray program."

The other replicas can continue processing requests while the replica is being restarted.\n\nPlease note that if you want to let pending tasks finish before killing the actor, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead. This will queue a termination task and run any atexit handlers installed in the actor.\n\nIt's important to mention that a remote actor will be terminated when all actor handles to it in Python are deleted. This will cause the actor to complete any outstanding work and then shut down. If you only have one reference to an actor handle, calling `del actor` could trigger actor deletion. However, actor termination will not occur until the reference count goes to 0.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Python documentation on object deletion: [Python Object Deletion](https://docs.python.org/3.9/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__)\n\nPlease note that the provided context contains multiple snippets of information related to killing actors in different contexts."

The `lifetime` parameter is set to \"detached\", which means the actor will live as a global object independent of the creator.\n\nNote that named actors are scoped by namespace, and if no namespace is assigned, they will be placed in an anonymous namespace by default. You can retrieve the actor using `ray.get_actor(name=\"my_actor\", namespace=\"my_namespace\")`.\n\nTo set the namespace for your application, you can specify it when connecting to the cluster using `ray.init(namespace=\"hello\")`."

This is done to prevent contention between workers saving trial-level outputs. If you want to disable this behavior and access files in the original working directory, you can set the `chdir_to_trial_dir` flag to `False` in `tune.TuneConfig`. In this case, files are accessible with paths relative to the original working directory, but all workers on the same node will share the same working directory.\n\nIt's important to ensure that the directory is synced on all nodes if you are running on multiple machines. You can use `ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()` as the path to save any outputs in this case.\n\nPlease refer to the API Reference for more details and examples."

            "answer": "If you set `num_cpus=0` for tasks, it means that tasks will not be allocated any CPU resources for running. By default, tasks use 1 CPU resource for scheduling and 0 CPU for running. This means that tasks cannot get scheduled on a zero-CPU node, but an infinite number of them can run on any non-zero CPU node. The default value for tasks was chosen for historical reasons, but it is recommended to always explicitly set `num_cpus` for tasks to avoid any surprises.\n\nFor actors, the default value for `num_cpus` is also 0, which means that actors do not have CPUs assigned to them by default. It is recommended to always explicitly set `num_cpus` for actors to avoid any surprises. If resources are specified explicitly, they are required for both scheduling and running.\n\nYou can also explicitly specify a task's or actor's resource requirements, such as the number of CPUs or GPUs, instead of using the default values. This can be done using `ray.remote()` and `task.options()` or `actor.options()`.\n\nIn the context of Ray, when it starts on a machine, a number of Ray workers will be started automatically, with 1 worker per CPU by default. These workers are used to execute tasks, similar to a process pool. If you execute tasks with `num_cpus=2` and the total number of CPUs is 16, you will end up with some workers idling because there are more workers than tasks.\n\nAdditionally, when performing inference with deep learning models like PyTorch and Tensorflow, multithreading is often used, and the number of CPUs used is controlled by the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. Ray sets `OMP_NUM_THREADS=<num_cpus>` by default. If `num_cpus` is not specified for tasks or actors, Ray sets `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` to reduce contention between actors and tasks that run in a single thread.\n\nIf you want to run tasks on GPUs instead of CPUs, you can set `use_gpu=True`. The number of workers or actors you want to use can be specified with `num_workers`."

            "answer": "Yes, it is possible to have Ray on Kubernetes without using KubeRay. If the necessary Kubernetes admin permissions are not available for deploying KubeRay, you can deploy a static Ray cluster to Kubernetes without using KubeRay. However, it should be noted that this deployment method lacks the built-in autoscaling feature that KubeRay provides.\n\nTo enable autoscaling for a Ray cluster on Kubernetes, you can use the Ray autoscaler. The Ray autoscaler is a Ray cluster process that automatically scales the cluster up and down based on resource demand. It adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.\n\nTo configure the Ray autoscaler on Kubernetes, you can set the `enableInTreeAutoscaling` parameter to `true`. The KubeRay operator will then automatically configure an autoscaling sidecar container for the Ray head pod. The autoscaler container collects resource metrics from the Ray cluster and adjusts the replicas field of each workerGroupSpec as needed to fulfill the requirements of your Ray application. You can also set the `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` fields to constrain the number of replicas of an autoscaling workerGroup.\n\nThe Ray autoscaler and the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler complement each other. After the Ray autoscaler decides to create a Ray pod, the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can provision a Kubernetes node so that the pod can be placed. Similarly, after the Ray autoscaler decides to delete an idle pod, the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can clean up the idle Kubernetes node that remains.\n\nIt is recommended to configure your RayCluster so that only one Ray pod fits per Kubernetes node.\n\nTo enable Ray autoscaling in the KubeRay RayCluster custom resource (CR) config, you can follow the KubeRay quickstart guide and create an autoscaling RayCluster custom resource.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible to have Ray on Kubernetes without using KubeRay, using KubeRay or the Ray autoscaler provides built-in autoscaling capabilities for your Ray cluster."

Create an instance of the actor by calling the `remote()` method on the actor class and passing the parameters as arguments. For example:\n\n```python\nactor_handle = MyActor.remote(param1_value, param2_value)\n```\n\n3. The `remote()` method will return an actor handle that can be used to interact with the actor instance. You can call methods on the actor using the actor handle. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = actor_handle.my_method.remote(arg1, arg2)\n```\n\nNote that each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, so each actor will have its own copy of the class variables. Using instance variables to hold the global state and passing the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed is recommended."

The log feature is currently in alpha and requires the default installation.\n\n2. Check the logging directory where Ray log files are stored. By default, they are located in the `/tmp/ray/session_*/logs` directory. You can view the log files in this directory to understand how they are organized.\n\n3. Ray's system or component logs are structured by default. The logging format for Python logs is `%(asctime)s\\t%(levelname)s %(filename)s:%(lineno)s -- %(message)s`. Make sure you are using the correct format to search for `log.info` messages.\n\n4. If you want to see the logs of a specific worker, you can use the `ray logs` command with the appropriate worker ID and IP address.\n\n5. The Logs view in the Ray Cluster Dashboard lists all the Ray logs organized by node and log file name. You can use the search functionality in this view to find specific log messages.\n\n6. If you are running Ray applications as Ray Jobs, worker logs are always captured in the Ray logging directory. However, driver logs are only captured for Ray Jobs submitted via the Jobs API. You can find the captured driver logs using the Dashboard UI, CLI, or Python SDK.\n\n7. If you want to modify the logging configuration for Ray, you can import the `logging` module and use the appropriate logger name (`ray` for Ray logger, or specific logger names for other libraries) to modify the logging configuration."

When a task returns a result in the Ray object store, there is a possibility that the resulting object may be lost after the original task has finished. In such cases, Ray will try to recover the object by re-executing the tasks that created it, but this behavior is not applied to exceptions thrown by the application code.\n\nHowever, you have the option to control whether application-level errors are retried by configuring the max_retries and retry_exceptions options in the ray.remote() and .options() functions. By setting these options, you can specify the maximum number of retries for failed tasks due to application-level errors.\n\nIt's important to note that Ray does retry failed tasks due to system failures and specified application-level failures by default. The behavior can be modified by adjusting the max_retries and retry_exceptions options.\n\nIn summary, Ray does not automatically retry tasks upon exceptions thrown by application code, but you can customize this behavior using the provided options."

This command allows you to request the desired size for the cluster, and the cluster will immediately attempt to scale up to accommodate the requested resources. This bypasses the normal upscaling speed constraints.\n\nAdditionally, you can configure the Ray autoscaler using the Ray cluster launcher. The Ray autoscaler is a Ray cluster process that automatically scales the cluster up and down based on resource demand. It adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.\n\nIf you are using Kubernetes, you can configure the Ray autoscaler on Kubernetes. The autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.\n\nIt's important to tune certain parameters in Ray to run a large cluster effectively. You can refer to the documentation for more information on tuning Ray settings.\n\nFurthermore, Ray provides additional features and libraries for scaling and managing clusters. Ray AI Runtime Libraries allow you to scale the entire ML pipeline, while Ray Core provides foundational primitives for scaling generic Python code. Ray Clusters allow you to deploy a Ray cluster on various cloud platforms and seamlessly scale workloads for production.\n\nRemember to ensure compatibility between the Ray and Autoscaler code versions by running one autoscaler per Ray cluster and matching the code versions."

            "answer": "The issue you are facing with the Ray Dashboard disappearing after tunneling the port from the head node to your machine is not a known problem. However, there are a few things you can check to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. Make sure you have properly configured the dashboard for viewing it from outside the head node. When starting a remote Ray cluster, the dashboard port may not be publicly exposed by default. You may need to set up additional configurations to access the Ray Dashboard from outside the head node.\n\n2. Check if you have set up Prometheus and Grafana along with the Ray Dashboard. These tools are necessary for critical features such as Metrics View. Integrating Prometheus and Grafana with Ray Dashboard is highly recommended.\n\n3. Verify the port on which the Ray Dashboard is running. By default, the Ray Dashboard runs on port 8265 of the head node. You can customize the port if needed by following the instructions provided in the context.\n\n4. Ensure that you have proper authentication in place before exposing the Ray Dashboard publicly for security purposes.\n\n5. If you are using the VM Cluster Launcher, you can securely port-forward local traffic to the dashboard using the `ray dashboard` command. Make sure you specify the correct port and cluster config file.\n\n6. Double-check the URI and port to access the Ray Dashboard. For example, if you are running Ray Serve locally, you can access the dashboard by going to http://localhost:8265 in your browser.\n\n7. If you are still experiencing issues, you can try monitoring the cluster status using the `ray dashboard/status` command or the `ray status` command on the head node.\n\n8. Keep in mind that the Ray Dashboard runs as a separate subprocess, which can crash invisibly in the background. If the port becomes unreachable, restarting Ray (`ray stop` and `ray start`) may make it reachable again.\n\n9. If you don't want to use the dashboard, you can set the `--include-dashboard=false` flag.\n\nOverall, make sure you have followed the proper configuration steps and have the necessary dependencies in place to ensure the Ray Dashboard functions correctly."

            "answer": "To update files in the working directory, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the working directory for the Ray workers. It can be a local existing directory, a local existing zipped file, or a URI to a remotely-stored zip file containing the working directory for your job.\n\n2. Download the specified directory to each node on the cluster, and ensure that Ray workers are started in their node's copy of this directory.\n\n3. If you are using local mode, you can use the `_change_working_directory` context manager to change the working directory to the desired location. This can be done by setting the `trial.logdir` as the working directory.\n\n4. If you want to disable the behavior of changing the working directory, you can set the `chdir_to_trial_dir` flag to `False` in `tune.TuneConfig`. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes. Make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\n5. Update the configuration and make sure the log directory exists for each trial.\n\n6. To update the files in the working directory, you can use relative paths. For example, you can create a new directory within the trial directory using `os.makedirs(working_dir, exist_ok=True)` and then change the working directory to this new directory using `os.chdir(working_dir)`.\n\n7. If needed, you can manually move files to the desired location or use the `ray rsync-up` command to upload files from a local path to the working directory.\n\n8. Finally, you can write to a file directly within the trial directory. The working directory is set to the trial directory, so you don't need to worry about multiple workers saving to the same location. For example, you can use `with open(\"./artifact_{self.iteration}.txt\", \"w\") as f:` to write to a file named \"artifact_{iteration}.txt\".\n\nRemember to adjust the steps based on your specific use case and requirements."

            "answer": "The GCS server, also known as the Global Control Service, is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster. It runs on the Ray head node and is responsible for managing node membership, actor directory, and other cluster-level operations such as actor and placement group management.\n\nIf your GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node, it could be due to the additional stress placed on the head node in a large cluster deployment. The head node runs extra cluster-level processes like GCS and API server, which can consume more memory. Additionally, the GCS process on the head node is a centralized component that many other components in Ray communicate with, leading to increased memory usage.\n\nTo address this issue, you can adjust the maximum file descriptors limit per process using the ulimit command. It is recommended to apply ulimit -n 65536 to your host configuration or selectively apply it for Ray components. This can help handle a larger number of connections to GCS.\n\nFurthermore, the head node may have more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and executes the same number of tasks and actors, it can easily encounter out-of-memory problems. In such cases, it is advisable not to run any tasks and actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node.\n\nIt is important to note that the GCS is not fault-tolerant by default, as all the data is stored in-memory. If the GCS fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault-tolerant, you need to use HA Redis. When the GCS restarts, it loads all the data from the Redis instance and resumes regular functions. During the recovery period, certain functions may not be available.\n\nIn summary, the GCS server is responsible for managing cluster-level metadata and operations in a Ray cluster. If it is consuming a lot of memory on the head node, it could be due to the additional stress on the head node and the centralized nature of the GCS. Adjusting the maximum file descriptors limit and avoiding running tasks and actors on the head node can help mitigate memory issues. Additionally, using HA Redis can make the GCS fault-tolerant."

This will provide information about the current state of the cluster, including the number of healthy and pending nodes.\n\n2. If there are pending nodes, it could indicate that the head node is overloaded with simultaneous connections. One possible solution is to start the worker nodes more slowly. This can be done by modifying the configuration or script used to start the cluster.\n\n3. If the pending nodes are stuck in the Pending state, you can use the `kubectl describe pod` command to check for errors. Running `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` will provide detailed information about the pod and any errors encountered.\n\n4. Ensure that the Docker resource limits are set high enough. If the pods are stuck in the Pending state, it could be due to insufficient resources allocated to the containers. Adjusting the resource limits, such as CPU and memory, may resolve the issue.\n\n5. If you are running a large Ray cluster with more than 1k nodes, there are additional system settings that may need to be tuned to enable communication between such a large number of machines. Refer to the Ray documentation for guidance on running large clusters.\n\n6. If you encounter a warning message like \"The Ray cluster currently does not have any available CPUs,\" it indicates that the cluster resources are being used by other components such as Actors or Tune trials. You may need to free up CPUs by stopping or scaling down these components.\n\nBy following these steps and investigating the cluster status, pod descriptions, resource limits, and potential resource conflicts, you should be able to debug the issue of pending nodes when starting a Ray cluster with Ray up."

It operates on batches, which are Pandas DataFrames representing small amounts of data. By modifying batches instead of individual records, this class can efficiently transform a dataset with vectorized operations.\n\nThe `map_batches` method doesn't require fitting and can be called directly. It takes a user-defined function (`fn`) as the first parameter, which can be either a function or a class. The function-based UDFs run as short-running Ray tasks, while the class-based UDFs run as long-running Ray actors. If using class-based UDFs, the `compute` argument can be used to specify the ActorPoolStrategy with the number of parallel actors.\n\nThe `batch_size` argument indicates the number of items in each batch. It is recommended to choose a batch size small enough to comfortably fit into memory to avoid potential out-of-memory situations.\n\nIn summary, the `map_batches` operation preserves the order of the input data while applying the user-defined function to batches of the dataset."

Ray Serve uses Python's standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and HTTP proxy, as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas.\n\nAdditionally, when there is an application-level failure (i.e., the remote task/actor fails due to user code), the get API will raise a RayTaskError, which includes the exception raised from the remote process. This can provide more detailed information about the specific error.\n\nYou can also configure the fault tolerance behavior of Ray by setting the max_retries and retry_exceptions options in ray.remote() and .options(). This allows you to customize how Ray handles retries for failed tasks.\n\nIf you are experiencing performance issues, such as high latency or low throughput, you can set up monitoring with Ray and Ray Serve to identify and address these issues. Monitoring can help you track metrics like serve_num_router_requests and serve_deployment_processing_latency_ms to understand the behavior of your system and optimize performance.\n\nIn summary, to get more detailed errors or logs from Ray Serve, you can use Ray logging, handle application-level failures with the RayTaskError exception, configure fault tolerance behavior, and set up monitoring for performance debugging."

These logs include system-level logs from the Serve controller and HTTP proxy, as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas.\n\nDuring development, the logs are streamed to the driver Ray program, which is the Python script that calls `serve.run()` or the `serve run` CLI command. So, it's convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.\n\nIf you execute the driver directly on the head node of the Ray cluster or run with Ray Client, the driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, you can view the driver logs in the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output.\n\nTask and actor logs can be accessed from the Task and Actor table view in the Dashboard. Click the \"Log\" button to see the stdout and stderr logs that contain the output emitted from tasks and actors. For actors, you can also see the system logs for the corresponding worker process.\n\nFor Ray Jobs, worker logs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while driver logs are only captured for Ray Jobs submitted via the Jobs API. You can find the captured driver logs with the Dashboard UI, CLI (using the `ray job logs` command), or the Python SDK (`JobSubmissionClient.get_logs()` or `JobSubmissionClient.tail_job_logs()`).\n\nTo view the logs of a specific worker, you can use the `ray logs` command with the worker's IP address. For example: `ray logs worker-6f2ec5c8b0d5f5a66572859faf192d36743536c2e9702ea58084b037*out -ip 10.0.62.231`.\n\nYou can also parse the stored logs with a logging stack such as ELK or Loki to be able to search by deployment or replica. Serve supports log rotation of these logs through the environment variables `RAY_ROTATION_MAX_BYTES` and `RAY_ROTATION_BACKUP_COUNT`.\n\nTo configure logging or silence replica-level logs, you can configure the \"ray.serve\" logger inside the deployment constructor using the Python logging module.\n\nFull logs can be found in the file `runtime_env_setup-[job_id].log` for per-actor, per-task, and per-job environments, or in `runtime_env_setup-ray_client_server_[port].log` for per-job environments when using Ray Client. You can enable runtime_env debugging log streaming by setting the environment variable `RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_LOG_TO_DRIVER_ENABLED=1` on each node before starting Ray.\n\nRay client logs can be found at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs` on the head node.\n\nThe Logs view in the Dashboard lists the Ray logs in your cluster, organized by node and log file name. It provides search functionality to help you find specific log messages. If the Ray Job is submitted by the Job API, the Job logs are available from the Dashboard, and the log file follows the format: `job-driver-<job_submission_id>.log`."

You can do this by running `kubectl logs -f <kuberay-operator-pod-name>` (e.g., `kubectl logs -f kuberay-operator-7447d85d58-lv7pf`). The Kuberay operator logs contain information about the Serve application deployment event and Serve application health checks.\n\nFor a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application's states, you can use the Ray dashboard. The dashboard provides details such as the number of deployment replicas currently running, logs for the Serve controller, deployment replicas, and HTTP proxies, and the Ray nodes running in your cluster.\n\nTo inspect deeper into the applications running on the cluster, you can go to the Ray Serve dashboard at `http://localhost:8265/#/serve`. The dashboard allows you to see all applications deployed on the Ray cluster, the list of deployments under each application, and the list of replicas for each deployment.\n\nRay client logs can be found at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs` on the head node. These logs contain messages from Ray Serve actors, indicating which actor (Serve controller, HTTP proxy, or deployment replica) created the log and its process ID. The rest of the log messages are the actual log statements generated by the actor.\n\nIf you are using the Ray Dashboard, you can find logs related to it. The log files include `dashboard.[log|err]`, which contain logs generated from the dashboard's logger, and `dashboard_agent.log`, which is a log file of the dashboard agent. Additionally, the GCS server, which manages Ray cluster metadata, has log files named `gcs_server.[out|err]`."

Checkpoint loading occurs when a trial is configured to retry after encountering a failure, when the experiment is being restored, or when a trial is being resumed after a pause (e.g., PBT).\n\nHere's an example of how trial checkpoints are saved in Tune:\n\n```python\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    my_trainable,\n    run_config=air.RunConfig(\n        name=\"my-tune-exp\",\n        storage_path=\"/tmp/mypath\",\n        checkpoint_config=air.CheckpointConfig(\n            checkpoint_score_attribute=\"max-auc\",\n            checkpoint_score_order=\"max\",\n            num_to_keep=5,\n        ),\n    )\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, trial checkpoints will be saved in the following directory structure:\n\n```\n/tmp/mypath/my-tune-exp/<trial_name>/checkpoint_<step>\n```\n\nTo load the checkpoints, you can iterate over the checkpoint paths and load the experiment states. Here's an example of how to load checkpoints from the latest checkpoint paths:\n\n```python\ndef _load_checkpoints_from_latest(self, latest_checkpoint: List[str]) -> None:\n    # Collect all checkpoints and their directory paths.\n    for path in latest_checkpoint:\n        with open(path) as f:\n            experiment_state = json.load(f, cls=TuneFunctionDecoder)\n            self._experiment_states.append(experiment_state)\n\n        if \"checkpoints\" not in experiment_state:\n            raise TuneError(\"Experiment state invalid; no checkpoints found.\")\n```\n\nYou can adapt this code to load all the checkpoints from the trial paths obtained from `session.get_checkpoint()`.\n\nRemember to configure the storage path and checkpoint settings appropriately when launching your Tune experiment to ensure the checkpoints are saved and accessible for analysis."

For example, if you want to set the maximum concurrent tasks to 5, you can use `max_concurrent=5` when calling the `map_batches` method.\n\nIn the provided context, there are multiple mentions of `map_batches` being executed with different levels of concurrency. The progress bars indicate the completion of the tasks. The `map_batches` method is being used to parallelize the processing of batches. The number of parallel tasks depends on the available resources, such as GPUs and partitions of the dataset.\n\nIn one example, it is mentioned that the dataset is repartitioned into 100 partitions before mapping batches. This is done to ensure that there are enough parallel tasks to utilize all available GPUs. The number of partitions can be adjusted based on the number of available GPUs in the cluster.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the `max_concurrent` value passed to `map_batches` will override any other value set elsewhere.

            "answer": "In general, it is not necessary for the Ray head node and all workers to have the same object store memory size allocated. The Ray head node typically has more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard, and it also runs singleton processes responsible for cluster management. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of Tasks and Actors from the head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems.\n\nTo avoid this, it is recommended not to run any Tasks and Actors on the head node by specifying `--num-cpus=0` when starting a head node using `ray start --head`. This ensures that the head node is not used for executing tasks and actors.\n\nThe object store memory is used when your application creates objects in the object store via `ray.put` and when it returns values from remote functions. By default, Ray reserves 30% of available memory for the object store. The size of the object store can be controlled using the `--object-store-memory` flag.\n\nIt is important to note that the object store memory is different from the shared memory used when reading objects via `ray.get`. The shared memory allows large objects to be efficiently shared among many actors and tasks.\n\nIn summary, while the object store memory size can be controlled separately for the head node and workers, it is recommended to avoid running tasks and actors on the head node to prevent out-of-memory issues."

If this variable is not set, Ray Dashboard will use the value of `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`.\n\nIf both Grafana and the Ray Cluster are on the same Kubernetes cluster, set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to the external URL of the Grafana ingress.\n\nTo set these variables more intelligently, considering that the head node IP is changing every time the cluster is reconfigured, you can use dynamic DNS or a service like Kubernetes ExternalDNS to automatically update the DNS record for the Grafana and Prometheus hosts. This way, you can use a domain name instead of an IP address in the variable values.\n\nFor example, if the IP of the head node is 55.66.77.88 and Grafana is hosted on port 3000, you can set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to `http://55.66.77.88:3000`.\n\nMake sure to properly configure these environment variables when starting the Ray Clusters. If all the variables are set correctly, you should see time-series metrics in the Ray Dashboard.\n\nNote: If you encounter an error stating that `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` is not set up despite having set it up, check that you have included the protocol in the URL (e.g., `http://your-grafana-url.com` instead of `your-grafana-url.com`) and that the URL doesn't have a trailing slash (e.g., `http://your-grafana-url.com` instead of `http://your-grafana-url.com/`).\n\nAdditionally, it is highly recommended to set up Prometheus and Grafana when using the Ray Dashboard, as they are necessary for critical features such as Metrics View."

The KubeRay operator then deletes that pod. This is important for Ray applications because downscaling a random pod could be dangerous.\n\nWhen using KubeRay autoscaling, the autoscaler container collects resource metrics from the Ray cluster and automatically adjusts the replicas field of each workerGroupSpec as needed to fulfill the requirements of your Ray application. The autoscaler determines which Kubernetes pod to kill based on these metrics and the scaling rules configured for the autoscaler.\n\nIt is recommended to configure your RayCluster so that only one Ray pod fits per Kubernetes node. This ensures efficient utilization of resources and allows the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to provision or clean up nodes based on the decisions made by the Ray autoscaler.\n\nOverall, the KubeRay autoscaler provides more control and flexibility in scaling down pods compared to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler."

Set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: Ray provides GPU isolation by automatically setting the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable. Most machine learning frameworks respect this variable for GPU assignment. Ray will handle this automatically, so you don't need to manually set it.\n\n3. Specify GPU resource requirements: Ray natively supports GPU as a pre-defined resource type. You can specify the GPU resource requirements for your tasks and actors in your Ray code. This will ensure that Ray schedules your tasks and actors on machines with available GPUs.\n\nBy following these steps, you can make the GPU on your M1 laptop available to Ray for machine learning applications."

For example, in the `ray.train.horovod.HorovodConfig` and `ray.train.torch.TorchConfig` configurations, you can set the `timeout_s` parameter to specify the timeout duration in seconds.\n\nHere's an example of how to set the timeout for a Ray job using the `timeout_s` parameter:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.train.horovod import HorovodConfig\n\nconfig = HorovodConfig(timeout_s=300)\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can set an end-to-end timeout for HTTP requests by setting the `request_timeout_s` in the `http_options` field of the Serve config. This timeout applies to HTTP requests made within your Ray cluster.\n\nIt's worth noting that Ray Client, which is useful for developing interactively in a local Python shell, has a default termination time of 30 seconds if the connection to the remote cluster is lost. For long-running workloads, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs instead.\n\nIf you are using Ray tasks or actors, you can also specify a timeout when calling `ray.get()` or `ray.wait()` to limit the time the client waits for a result.\n\n```python\nresult = ray.get(object_id, timeout=10)  # Wait for 10 seconds for the result\n```\n\nBy setting a timeout, you can control the maximum duration a Ray job should run before timing out."

This variable defines where the temporary directory for the cluster files should be created. The directory specified by RAY_TEMPDIR needs to be accessible by the host, the outer container, and the inner container.\n\nFor example, if you want to set the /tmp directory to \"/ray-mount\", you can set the RAY_TEMPDIR environment variable to \"/ray-mount\". In the case where the shared directory has a different name on the host, you can rewrite the mount points dynamically. For instance, if the directory on the host is /ray and in the outer container /ray-mount, you can set RAY_TEMPDIR=\"/ray-mount\".\n\nAdditionally, when running on a remote cluster, you need to ensure that the import path is accessible. You can deploy to a specific address using the command \"serve deploy config_file.yaml -a [RAY_CLUSTER_URI]\". The Ray Dashboard agent's default port is 52365, but you can set it to a different value using the \"--dashboard-agent-listen-port\" argument when running \"ray start\".\n\nTo access the Ray Dashboard of a remote cluster over HTTP, you can set up port forwarding from your local machine to the head node. One way to do this is by using the \"ray dashboard\" command with the cluster configuration file. For example, you can run \"ray dashboard cluster.yaml\" to set up the port forwarding.\n\nIn summary, to set a custom /tmp directory for a remote cluster:\n1. Set the RAY_TEMPDIR environment variable to the desired directory path.\n2. Ensure the import path is accessible.\n3. Deploy to the remote cluster using the appropriate address.\n4. Set up port forwarding to access the Ray Dashboard of the remote cluster."

            "answer": "To access logs for a dead node in Ray, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the node ID or node IP of the dead node. You can use the `ray list nodes` command to get this information.\n\n2. Use the `list_logs` function from the `ray.util.state` module to fetch the log files from the head node. By default, the API prints logs from a head node. Provide the head node ID to list the logs from the same node.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   from ray.util.state import list_logs\n\n   # Get the node ID from `ray list nodes`\n   list_logs(node_id=<HEAD_NODE_ID>)\n   ```\n\n3. If you want to access a specific log file from a node, you can use the `get_log` function. Provide the filename and node ID as parameters to retrieve the log file.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   from ray.util.state import get_log\n\n   node_id = ray.nodes()[0][\"NodeID\"]\n   filename = \"raylet.out\"\n\n   for line in get_log(filename=filename, node_id=node_id):\n       print(line)\n   ```\n\nPlease note that you cannot access logs from a dead node directly. Additionally, Ray does not provide a native storage solution for log data, so you need to manage the lifecycle of the logs yourself."

            "answer": "There are several reasons for a node to change its status to dead:\n\n1. Node Failure: When a node fails, it is marked as dead. This can happen due to various reasons such as hardware failure, network issues, or software crashes.\n\n2. Raylet Failure: If a raylet process fails, the corresponding node will be marked as dead. Even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n\n3. Worker Node Failure: When a worker node fails, the actors running on it also fail. Serve detects the failure of actors and attempts to respawn them on the remaining healthy nodes. KubeRay detects the node failure and tries to restart the worker pod on another running node. It also brings up a new healthy node to replace the failed one.\n\n4. Slow Actor Creation: If the actor creation process is slow, it can lead to the node being marked as dead. This can happen if there are many entries in the scheduler queue or if the actor creation is delayed due to slow runtime environment creation or worker startup.\n\n5. Actor Termination: Actors can be terminated intentionally or unintentionally. If an actor is killed using the `ray.kill` command, it will be marked as dead with a specific death cause. Similarly, if the worker process of an actor dies, the actor will be marked as dead with an appropriate death cause.\n\nIt is important to note that when a node is marked as dead, the system takes necessary actions to recover and redistribute the workload to healthy nodes to ensure uninterrupted service."

            "answer": "Based on the provided context, there are a few reasons for spikes in node CPU utilization:\n\n1. Resource contention or hangs: This can occur when there is not enough CPU capacity available for Dataset execution. To avoid this, it is recommended to reserve at least 20% of node CPUs for Dataset execution by setting `_max_cpu_fraction_per_node = 0.8` in the Trainer scaling_config.\n\n2. Memory usage exceeding the threshold: In one of the logs, it is mentioned that the memory on the node where the task was running exceeded the memory usage threshold of 0.95. As a result, Ray killed the worker. This indicates that the spike in CPU utilization could be related to high memory usage, which can impact overall system performance.\n\n3. Low memory on the node: Another log mentions that the task was killed due to the node running low on memory. This suggests that the spike in CPU utilization could be a result of the system trying to handle memory-related issues.\n\nIt is important to monitor both CPU and memory usage to identify the root cause of the spikes in CPU utilization and take appropriate actions to optimize resource allocation and prevent resource contention."

However, you mentioned that the node is still up and running.\n\nThere could be several reasons for this error, including:\n\n1. The worker node cannot connect to the head node: This can be caused by issues such as the head node not running, a different version of Ray running at the specified address, an incorrect address specified, or firewall settings preventing access. You can use the command \"ip route get xx.xx.xx.xx\" on the worker node to debug any routing issues.\n\n2. GCS failure: The Global Control Service (GCS) is a server that manages cluster-level metadata and operations. By default, the GCS is not fault-tolerant, meaning that if it fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault-tolerant, High Availability (HA) Redis is required. When the GCS restarts, it loads all the data from the Redis instance and resumes regular functions. During the recovery period, certain functions may not be available.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can check if the head node is running and accessible at the specified address. You can also verify that the worker node can connect to the head node by checking for any firewall settings that may be blocking access. Additionally, ensure that the correct version of Ray is running.\n\nIf the issue persists, you may need to provide more specific information or consult the documentation or support resources for the specific software or framework you are using."

Ray provides a convenient API in `ray.util.metrics` for defining and exporting custom metrics for visibility into your applications. These metrics can be exported using the provided API functions such as Counter, Gauge, and Histogram. Ray exports metrics if you use Ray with the Dashboard component, which is responsible for aggregating and reporting metrics to the endpoints for Prometheus to scrape. Ray exports both system metrics and application-specific metrics. System metrics include various physical and internal stats, while application metrics are useful for monitoring your application states. The Metrics view in Ray Dashboard provides access to default metrics, including tasks, actors, placement groups, resource usage, and autoscaler status. However, to view metrics in the Metrics view, you need to set up Prometheus and Grafana. Additionally, Ray also allows exporting metrics into other observability platforms like Arize."

            "answer": "To avoid objects from getting spilled in Ray, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. Increase the available memory: If the object store is filling up quickly, you can try increasing the available memory by adding more resources to your cluster or allocating more memory to Ray.\n\n2. Optimize object serialization: Efficient serialization of objects can help reduce their memory footprint. Make sure you are using an efficient serialization method for your objects.\n\n3. Configure the object spilling directory: By default, objects are spilled to Ray's temporary directory in the local filesystem. You can configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using the `object_spilling_config` parameter when initializing Ray. For example:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport ray\n\nray.init(\n    _system_config={\n        \"object_spilling_config\": json.dumps(\n            {\"type\": \"filesystem\", \"params\": {\"directory_path\": \"/tmp/spill\"}},\n        )\n    },\n)\n```\n\n4. Use SSD instead of HDD: If possible, use a solid-state drive (SSD) instead of a hard disk drive (HDD) for better performance when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads.\n\n5. Specify a large buffer size: To reduce IO requests during spilling, it is recommended to specify a large buffer size (> 1MB). This can be done by setting the `buffer_size` parameter in the `object_spilling_config`. For example:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport ray\n\nray.init(\n    _system_config={\n        \"object_spilling_config\": json.dumps(\n            {\n              \"type\": \"filesystem\",\n              \"params\": {\n                \"directory_path\": \"/tmp/spill\",\n                \"buffer_size\": 1_000_000,\n              }\n            },\n        )\n    },\n)\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can optimize object spilling in Ray and reduce the chances of objects getting spilled."

Get a handle to the Serve controller using the NAME from the ray list actor output, and then use `ray.kill()` to kill the controller. Set `no_restart` to `True` to prevent the controller from being restarted.\n\nAfter you're done testing, you can shut down Ray Serve by interrupting the serve run command (e.g., with Ctrl-C).
