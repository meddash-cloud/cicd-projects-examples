To avoid potential out-of-memory situations, ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large. Additionally, when calling `map_batches()`, use a batch size that is small enough for the output batch to comfortably fit into memory.\n\nIt is worth noting that the `map`, `flat_map`, and `filter` operations in Ray Data are unvectorized and can be slow. If you are using a vectorized transformation, consider using `.map_batches()` instead.\n\nFor more information on processing data with Ray Data, you can refer to the \"Transforming Data\" section. There are also various code examples and tutorials available for batch processing, OCR processing, and training ML models using Ray Data."

The Ray Serve autoscaler, which is an application-level autoscaler, interacts with the Ray Autoscaler to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there are not enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider, which responds by adding more nodes. Autoscaling can be configured in a Serve application by setting the autoscaling field in the Serve config. In a KubeRay Cluster, autoscaling can be enabled by setting enableInTreeAutoscaling to True, with additional options available to configure the autoscaling behavior."

            "answer": "If you use AsyncIO's `await` to wait for a Ray future like `await x.remote()`, it means you are waiting for the result of the remote operation to be available. With Ray, every remote operation is asynchronous, so when you invoke a remote operation, it immediately returns a promise/future, which is essentially an identifier (ID) of the operation's result. By using `await`, you are suspending the execution of the current coroutine until the result is available.\n\nIn the provided context, it is mentioned that Ray allows the invocation of remote operations to be asynchronous, and the programmer needs to call `ray.get()` on the IDs of the results to retrieve the actual results. However, instead of using `ray.get()`, you can use AsyncIO's `await` to wait for the Ray future to be resolved. This allows you to integrate Ray futures with existing concurrent applications that use AsyncIO.\n\nIt is important to note that if you use `ray.get()` or `await` to wait for the result of a remote operation, it will block the execution until the result is available. This means that if you wait for a remote operation to finish before spawning the next call in a loop, you will not achieve parallelism. To achieve parallelism, you should launch multiple remote operations and then wait for their results asynchronously using `await` or `ray.get()`.\n\nIn summary, using AsyncIO's `await` to wait for a Ray future allows you to wait for the result of a remote operation asynchronously, enabling parallelism in your program."

            "answer": "Ray may overload a node with more tasks than the resources allow if the tasks or actors use more than their proportionate share of memory. This can lead to issues like Out of Memory (OOM). To prevent this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them. Ray ensures that the sum of the resource requirements of all concurrently running tasks and actors on a node does not exceed the node's total resources. It is recommended to adjust the resource requirements of each task instead of manually controlling task parallelism. Additionally, the Ray head node, which has memory-demanding system components, can easily have out-of-memory problems if the same number of tasks and actors are executed from it. In such cases, it is advised not to run any tasks and actors on the head node. The memory resource requirement for each task is logical, meaning that Ray does not enforce the physical memory usage if it exceeds the specified amount."

Load imbalances can cause bottlenecks, so it's important to evenly distribute the load across the key space to avoid this.\n\nIf you have a large model that needs to be loaded and passed efficiently in a Ray cluster, the recommended approach is to let the driver load the model from a storage system, use `ray.put(model)` to store the model into the object store, and then pass the same reference of the model to each remote task when launching them."

            "answer": "To set up the model to communicate gradient updates across machines in Ray AIR, a few changes need to be made to the code. First, import Ray Train and Ray AIR Session using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport ray.train as train\n```\n\nThis will allow you to distribute the training across multiple workers and use data-parallel training by sharding the training data. The model will then be able to communicate gradient updates across machines. Once the training is complete, the results can be reported back to Ray Train.\n\nRay Train is a scalable machine learning library for distributed training and fine-tuning. It abstracts away the complexities of distributed computing and allows you to scale model training code from a single machine to a cluster of machines in the cloud. It supports various frameworks, including the PyTorch ecosystem.\n\nRay AIR leverages Ray Data for data loading and Ray Train for distributed training. It provides seamless integration with hyperparameter tuning and scalable model serving.\n\nOverall, Ray provides a distributed compute framework that simplifies the process of developing and deploying large-scale AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and generative AI."

Install Ray Serve: Use the Ray Serve CLI to deploy your Serve application to production on a Ray cluster. The command \"serve deploy\" takes a config file path and deploys it to a Ray cluster over HTTP. This can be a local, single-node cluster or a remote, multi-node cluster started with the Ray Cluster Launcher.\n\n2. Configure your deployment: Ray Serve allows you to configure your deployments to scale out by increasing the number of deployment replicas and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs. This can be done using the Ray Serve CLI.\n\n3. Improve performance: Ray Serve has features for batching and can integrate with any model optimization technique to improve the performance of your LLM applications. It also supports streaming responses, which is useful for chatbot-like applications.\n\n4. Deploy on Kubernetes (recommended): The recommended way to deploy Ray Serve is on Kubernetes, as it provides the best of both worlds - the user experience and scalable compute of Ray Serve, along with the operational benefits of Kubernetes. You can install and use the KubeRay operator to deploy a Ray Serve application using a RayService on Kubernetes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can rapidly prototype, develop, and deploy scalable LLM applications to production using Ray Serve."

Check the logs: The provided context suggests that you can use the command `ray logs raylet.out -ip <node_ip>` to see more information about the workers killed on the specific node. You can replace `<node_ip>` with the IP address of the node where the worker died. This will provide you with detailed logs that can help identify the cause of the issue.\n\n2. Memory pressure and OOM: The logs indicate that some workers were killed due to memory pressure (OOM - Out of Memory). Ray has an application-level memory monitor that kills workers before the Linux out-of-memory killer executes. This is to prevent the system from crashing. You should check the memory usage of your worker nodes and ensure that they have enough resources to handle the workload.\n\n3. TensorFlow optimizations: The logs also mention that the TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use specific CPU instructions. This information is provided for each worker in the cluster. Make sure that your worker nodes meet the CPU requirements for running TensorFlow with these optimizations.\n\n4. Check for other reasons: Apart from memory pressure, there could be other reasons for workers crashing. The logs mention that some workers crashed due to reasons other than memory pressure. It would be helpful to investigate these logs to identify any additional issues or errors that might be causing the worker nodes to die.\n\n5. Routing issues: The context also mentions the possibility of routing issues, where the IP address of a node does not match the Raylet address. This can happen when connecting the Ray cluster with a different IP address or when connecting a container. Ensure that the network configuration is correct and that all nodes can communicate properly.\n\n6. Consider starting worker nodes more slowly: The last part of the context suggests that overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections can cause failures. If you are starting all 1500 worker nodes at once, it might be overwhelming the system. Consider starting the worker nodes more slowly to avoid this issue.\n\nBy following these steps and analyzing the provided logs, you should be able to debug the issue and identify the root cause of the worker nodes dying."

Debugging routing issues: Failures in the log, such as mismatched IP addresses, can occur when connecting a Ray cluster with a different IP address or container. Overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections can also cause failures. Starting worker nodes more slowly can be a solution.\n\n4. Worker node failure: Simulating a worker node failure can be done by examining the nodes and pods running in the Kubernetes cluster. This can be achieved by using the command \"kubectl get nodes\".\n\n5. Head node failure: Simulating a head node failure can be done by killing the head pod or the head node. To observe the running pods in the cluster, the command \"kubectl get pods -o wide\" can be used.\n\n6. Raylet failure: When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated as a node failure. Even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n\n7. Head node failure: If a head node fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. To tolerate head node failures, making the Global Control Store (GCS) fault-tolerant is necessary to ensure that all cluster-level data is retained when starting a new head node."

If you want to manually control the cluster size without using the autoscaler, you can use the `request_resources` function to request the desired number of resources.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the `request_resources` function:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.autoscaler.sdk import request_resources\n\nray.init()\n\n# Request 4 CPUs and 2 GPUs for the cluster\nrequest_resources(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=2)\n\n# Wait for the requested resources to be allocated\nray.wait_for_resources([\"CPU\", \"GPU\"])\n\n# Your code here\n\n# When you're done, release the resources\nray.release_resources([\"CPU\", \"GPU\"])\n```\n\nThis will programmatically request the specified number of CPUs and GPUs for your Ray cluster and wait for them to be allocated before proceeding with your code. Once you're done, you can release the resources using the `release_resources` function.\n\nNote that this approach allows you to manually control the cluster size, but it doesn't provide the automatic scaling capabilities of the autoscaler. If you want to use the autoscaler, you can refer to the Ray Autoscaler documentation for more information on how to configure and use it with Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler."

            "answer": "In the context of Ray datasets, a batch refers to a user-facing object that represents a number of data points used for computing and applying one gradient update to the model weights during model training. On the other hand, a block is an internal abstraction and a processing unit of data within a dataset. A dataset consists of a collection of blocks, where each block contains a disjoint subset of rows. Ray Data partitions rows into distributed data blocks to enable parallel operations.\n\nIt is important to note that a large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, it is recommended to ensure that no single item in the Ray Data is too large and to use a small enough batch size when calling `ds.map_batches()` to ensure that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\n\nRay Data provides a higher-level API for offline batch inference with built-in optimizations, allowing for scalable batch prediction on large datasets at high prediction throughput. However, for more control, the lower-level Ray Core APIs can be used."

This will allow you to edit the Ray source code. \n\n2. If you are a contributor to the Ray project and need to debug, you can refer to the debugging guide specifically designed for Ray developers.\n\n3. For production deployment scenarios, you can refer to the guides for deploying Ray on VMs and Kubernetes for more details.\n\n4. One way to set up dependencies is by using the Ray Cluster launcher. You can prepare a single environment across the cluster before starting the Ray runtime. This can be done by building all your files and dependencies into a container image and specifying it in your Cluster YAML Configuration. Alternatively, you can install packages using setup_commands in the Ray Cluster configuration file, which will be run as each node joins the cluster.\n\n5. It is recommended to set up a Python virtual environment. For example, you can use Anaconda's conda. Create a conda environment named \"ray\" by running the following command:\n   ```\n   conda create -c conda-forge python=3.9 -n ray\n   ```\n\n6. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:\n   ```\n   conda activate ray\n   ```\n\n   Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you start a new shell/terminal to work on Ray.\n\n7. If you are using MacOS, it is advised to use runtime environments provided by Ray to avoid dependency conflicts. Runtime environments allow you to override the default environment on the Ray Cluster and run in an isolated environment, similar to virtual environments in single-node Python. These environments can include both files and Python packages."

At runtime, a deployment consists of a number of replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function that are started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down to match the incoming request load. Deployments are load balanced across their replicas. Ray Serve provides options to configure deployments, such as scaling out by increasing the number of replicas and assigning replica resources like CPUs and GPUs. In Ray Serve 2.0, a new deployment API was released, although the 1.x deployment API can still be used but will be deprecated in future versions.

            "answer": "To utilize the 'zero-copy' feature provided by Ray for numpy arrays, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure that you have Ray installed and initialized in your code.\n2. Use the `ray.get()` function to retrieve the numpy array from a remote task. For example:\n   ```python\n   ray.get(f.remote(np.zeros(100)))\n   ```\n   This will retrieve the numpy array without copying it.\n3. If you need to mutate the array, you will need to make a copy of it in the local process memory. You can do this by using the `copy()` method of the numpy array. For example:\n   ```python\n   arr = arr.copy()\n   ```\n   Note that by making a copy, you effectively disable the zero-copy deserialization feature provided by Ray.\n\nIt is important to note that numpy arrays in Ray are stored as read-only objects, and any writes to the read-only object will require you to first copy it into the local process memory.\n\nHere is an example of how to avoid the read-only assignment issue and manually copy the array if needed:\n```python\ntry:\n    ray.get(f.remote(np.zeros(100)))\nexcept ray.exceptions.RayTaskError as e:\n    print(e)\n    # ValueError: assignment destination is read-only\n    # arr[0] = 1\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively utilize the zero-copy feature provided by Ray for numpy arrays."

This approach is more efficient because it allows for the reuse of model initialization for many tasks, resulting in the node spending more time on the actual workload. Additionally, using an actor-based approach allows for more flexible scheduling of tasks and is recommended when the stateful part of an actor is needed. However, if the stateful part of an actor is not required, it is generally better to use tasks instead."

            "answer": "The advantages of using a singleton actor include:\n\n1. Efficiency: Singleton actors reuse model initialization for multiple tasks, allowing the node to spend more time on the actual workload.\n\n2. Concurrency: Threaded actors can be used to achieve concurrency, allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously.\n\n3. Global State Management: Singleton actors can hold the global state and pass the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed. This avoids the use of global variables, which can lead to issues with sharing state between tasks and actors.\n\n4. Object Store Optimization: By avoiding multiple copies of the same object in the object store, the object store is less likely to fill up prematurely and incur the cost of object eviction.\n\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to using singleton actors:\n\n1. Lack of Address Space Sharing: Ray drivers, tasks, and actors run in different processes and do not share the same address space. Modifying global variables in one process does not reflect changes in other processes.\n\n2. Interference and Reliability: Simultaneous jobs can interfere with each other, making them less reliable to run in production. Ray does not support priorities, so there is no way to prioritize important jobs under load.\n\n3. Access Control: Ray does not support access control, meaning that jobs have full access to a Ray cluster and all of its resources. This can be a security concern.\n\nIn summary, using a singleton actor can provide efficiency, concurrency, and better global state management. However, it also has limitations in terms of address space sharing, interference, reliability, and access control."

In this case, since a class is being used, the UDF will run as long-running Ray actors. \n\nFor class-based UDFs, you can use the `compute` argument to specify the `ActorPoolStrategy` with the number of parallel actors. The `batch_size` argument indicates the number of images in each batch.\n\nHere is an example of how you can write the map function:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize any necessary variables or resources\n    \n    def process_batch(self, batch):\n        # Process the batch of data and return a list of objects\n        result = []\n        for data in batch:\n            # Process each data item and generate an object\n            obj = process_data(data)\n            result.append(obj)\n        return result\n\ndef map_batches(data, batch_size):\n    # Split the data into batches\n    batches = [data[i:i+batch_size] for i in range(0, len(data), batch_size)]\n    \n    # Create a list to store the results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Create the actors\n    actors = [MyActor.remote() for _ in range(len(batches))]\n    \n    # Process each batch using the actors\n    for actor, batch in zip(actors, batches):\n        results.append(actor.process_batch.remote(batch))\n    \n    # Get the results\n    results = ray.get(results)\n    \n    # Flatten the results list\n    results = [item for sublist in results for item in sublist]\n    \n    return results\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyActor` class is defined as a long-running Ray actor. The `process_batch` method is responsible for processing each batch of data and returning a list of objects.\n\nThe `map_batches` function takes the input data and the desired batch size as parameters. It splits the data into batches and creates the necessary actors. Then, it processes each batch using the actors and collects the results. Finally, it flattens the results list and returns it.\n\nNote that you need to have Ray installed and initialized before using this code. You can refer to the Ray documentation for more information on how to set up and use Ray."

This parameter divides episodes into fragments of a specified number of steps each during rollouts. Trajectories of this size are collected from rollout workers and combined into a larger batch for learning.\n\nFor example, if you set `rollout_fragment_length` to 100 and `train_batch_size` to 1000, RLlib will collect 10 fragments of 100 steps each from rollout workers. These fragments are then concatenated, and an epoch of SGD is performed.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `complete_episodes` setting to ensure that each rollout only contains full episodes, from the beginning to the terminal state. This means that there will be no episode fragments in the rollout. The `rollout_fragment_length` parameter defines the minimum number of timesteps that will be covered in each rollout.\n\nTo make the buffer store only complete episodes found in a batch, you can use the following configuration line:\n\n`config.training(replay_buffer_config={\"storage_unit\": StorageUnit.EPISODES})`\n\nThis will ensure that the buffer only stores complete episodes and not episode fragments."

            ],
            "answer": "To set the memory limit for each trial in Ray Tuner, you can use the trial's resource specification. There are two options for specifying resources: `resources_per_trial` and `trial.placement_group_factory`. \n\nBy default, `Tuner.fit` will execute until all trials stop or error. You can see the memory usage on each node in the trial run output. For example:\n\n```\n== Status ==\nMemory usage on this node: 11.4/16.0 GiB\nUsing FIFO scheduling algorithm.\nResources requested: 1/12 CPUs, 0/0 GPUs, 0.0/3.17 GiB heap, 0.0/1.07 GiB objects\nResult logdir: /Users/foo/ray_results/myexp\nNumber of trials: 1 (1 RUNNING)\n```\n\nTo limit concurrency in Tune, you can set the maximum number of trials to run concurrently using `max_concurrent_trials` in `TuneConfig`. However, the actual parallelism may be less than `max_concurrent_trials` and will depend on the available resources in the cluster. For example, if you have a trial that requires 16 GPUs, your cluster has 32 GPUs, and `max_concurrent_trials=10`, the Tuner can only run 2 trials concurrently.\n\nTo control console output with Tune, you can use a Reporter object to customize the console output. User-provided fields will be outputted automatically on a best-effort basis. The console output will show the memory usage, resources requested, result log directory, and the number of trials running. For example:\n\n```\n== Status ==\nMemory usage on this node: 11.4/16.0 GiB\nUsing FIFO scheduling algorithm.\nResources requested: 4/12 CPUs, 0/0 GPUs, 0.0/3.17 GiB heap, 0.0/1.07 GiB objects\nResult logdir: /Users/foo/ray_results/myexp\nNumber of trials: 4 (4 RUNNING)\n```\n\nBy default, Tune reports experiment progress periodically to the command-line. The console output will show the same information as mentioned above.\n\nThe trial scheduler in Ray Tune decides how to allocate resources to trials. The most common resource allocated is time, where the scheduler determines which trials to run at what time. Some built-in schedulers like Asynchronous Hyperband (ASHA) perform early stopping of under-performing trials, while others like Population Based Training (PBT) will make under-performing trials copy the hyperparameter config and model weights.\n\nTo speed up the process, Ray Tune adaptively buffers results so that trial training can be continued earlier if many trials are running in parallel and report many results at the same time. However, processing hundreds of results per trial for dozens or hundreds of trials can become a bottleneck."

            "answer": "To send extra arguments in the `map_batches` function of the `ray.data.Dataset`, you need to define your user-defined function (UDF) as a class. Then, you can use the `compute` argument to specify the `ActorPoolStrategy` with the number of parallel actors. The `batch_size` argument indicates the number of images in each batch.\n\nHere is an example of how to send extra arguments in the `map_batches` function:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\nclass MyUDF:\n    def __init__(self, extra_arg):\n        self.extra_arg = extra_arg\n\n    def __call__(self, batch):\n        # Your UDF logic here\n        pass\n\ndataset = ray.data.Dataset(...)\nextra_arg = ...  # Your extra argument\n\ndataset.map_batches(MyUDF, compute=ray.actor.ActorPoolStrategy, num_actors=10, batch_size=32, extra_arg=extra_arg)\n```\n\nIn this example, `extra_arg` is the extra argument that you want to pass to your UDF. You can access this argument in your UDF's `__init__` method and use it in the `__call__` method.\n\nNote that you need to specify the number of GPUs (`num_gpus`) for each Ray Actor that will be running your callable class. Additionally, it is recommended to repartition the dataset into multiple partitions before mapping batches to ensure enough parallel tasks to take advantage of all the GPUs."

By default, Ray uses an internal key-value store for the GCS, which runs on the head node and stores cluster metadata. However, to ensure fault tolerance and high availability, Ray can also write this metadata to an external Redis database. When the GCS is backed by Redis, it can recover its state by reading from Redis when it restarts. If the GCS fails to reconnect to the raylet for more than 60 seconds, the raylet will exit and the corresponding node fails."

            "answer": "To resolve the ValueError: The actor ImplicitFunc is too large, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Move the data loader to the training function: The warning suggests that the actor TrainTrainable is very large. Check if its definition is implicitly capturing a large array or object in scope. To resolve this, move the data loader to the training function and make sure that the actor is not capturing any large objects implicitly. You can use ray.put() to put large objects in the Ray object store.\n\n2. Override the memory quota when creating the actor: You can specify the memory quota for the actor when creating it. For example, you can use the options() method to set the memory quota to 1GiB (1000 * 1024 * 1024) when creating the actor. This can be done as follows: SomeActor.options(memory=1000 * 1024 * 1024).remote(a=1, b=2).\n\n3. Check the batch size: The warning message also mentions that to ensure full parallelization across an actor pool of size 4, the specified batch size should be at most 5. Make sure that the configured batch size for the operator is not larger than the recommended value. In the provided context, the configured batch size is 16, which exceeds the recommended value.\n\n4. Use native types or Actors: To avoid serialization issues, try using only native types such as numpy arrays or lists/dicts of numpy arrays and other primitive types. Alternatively, you can use Actors to hold objects that cannot be serialized.\n\n5. Limit the number of running actors: Note that the number of running actors limits the number of concurrently running actor tasks. Make sure that the number of running actors is not exceeding the limit.\n\n6. Set memory quota dynamically: You can set the memory quota dynamically at runtime using the .options() method. For example, you can override the memory quota to 100MiB (100 * 1024 * 1024) when submitting the task. This can be done as follows: some_function.options(memory=100 * 1024 * 1024).remote(x=1).\n\n7. Check the definition of the actor: Make sure that the definition of the actor does not contain any large objects or arrays that could cause the actor to be too large.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ValueError: The actor ImplicitFunc is too large."

Initialize your Ray cluster using `ray.init()`. You can pass an address to connect to an existing cluster if needed.\n\n3. Use the `@ray.remote` decorator to transform functions into tasks and classes into actors. This allows you to execute code on the cluster.\n\n4. Use `ray.put()` to transfer values into Ray's object store. This is useful for large objects that need to be accessed by remote functions or classes. By using `ray.put()`, you can pass object references as arguments to the remote functions or classes.\n\n5. Use `ray.get()` to retrieve objects from the object store. This is a blocking operation, so it should be called as late as possible to avoid hurting parallelism. Only call `ray.get()` at the end to get the final result.\n\nHere is an example of using these methods:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\ndef my_function(x):\n    return x * 2\n\n# Put a value into Ray's object store\nvalue = ray.put(42)\n\n# Call the remote function and pass the object reference as an argument\nresult = my_function.remote(value)\n\n# Get the result from the object store\nfinal_result = ray.get(result)\n\nprint(final_result)  # Output: 84\n```\n\nRemember that these are just the basic steps to use `ray.put()` and `ray.get()`. The Ray API consists of more than just these two methods, but they are powerful if you're just starting out."

For example, a value of 0.5 means that half of the memory of the GPU will be allocated to the trial. However, it is important to note that you will have to ensure that your model still fits within the allocated fractional memory. If you use more GPU memory than what is specified, it may result in errors or unexpected behavior. Ray does not automatically handle the allocation of fractional GPUs for you, so it is the user's responsibility to manage the sharing of GPUs and ensure there is enough memory for multiple trials."

            "answer": "To pickle a variable defined in an actor's `__init__` method, you can follow the better approach mentioned in the context. \n\nFirst, define an actor class with an `__init__` method that initializes the variable you want to pickle. For example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass GlobalVarActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.global_var = 3\n```\n\nThen, define another actor class that takes an instance of the `GlobalVarActor` as an argument in its `__init__` method. This allows the second actor to access the variable defined in the first actor. For example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self, global_var_actor):\n        self.global_var_actor = global_var_actor\n\n    def f(self):\n        return ray.get(self.global_var_actor.get_global_var.remote()) + 3\n```\n\nTo set the value of the global variable, you can use the `set_global_var` method of the `GlobalVarActor` class. For example:\n\n```python\nglobal_var_actor = GlobalVarActor.remote()\nactor = Actor.remote(global_var_actor)\nray.get(global_var_actor.set_global_var.remote(4))\n```\n\nNow, you can call the `f` method of the `Actor` class to get the updated value of the global variable. For example:\n\n```python\nassert ray.get(actor.f.remote()) == 7\n```\n\nBy following this approach, the variable defined in the `__init__` method of the `GlobalVarActor` class can be pickled and accessed by other actors."

            "answer": "To get your project files on the cluster when using Ray Serve, you can use the `serve deploy` command with the `--address` argument. The `--address` argument allows you to specify the remote Ray cluster's dashboard agent address.\n\nHere is an example command:\n\n```\nserve deploy config.yaml --address <remote dashboard agent address>\n```\n\nThe `<remote dashboard agent address>` should be in the format `[RAY_CLUSTER_URI]:[DASHBOARD_AGENT_PORT]`. For example, if the address for the local cluster started by `ray start --head` is `http://127.0.0.1:52365`, you can deploy to this address using the command:\n\n```\nserve deploy config_file.yaml -a http://127.0.0.1:52365\n```\n\nNote that the default port for the Ray Dashboard agent is 52365. If you want to set a different port, you can use the `--dashboard-agent-listen-port` argument when starting Ray.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `serve run` command with the `--address` argument to connect to the remote cluster via Ray Client, upload the project files, and run your Serve application. Here is an example command:\n\n```\nserve run --address=ray://<head-node-ip-address>:10001 --working-dir=\"./project/src\" local_dev:graph\n```\n\nIn this command, the `--working-dir` argument specifies the local directory containing the project files that will be uploaded to the cluster. Make sure that the directory contains the necessary files, such as `local_dev.py`, which will be imported by Ray Serve.\n\nOnce your application is up and running on the remote cluster, you can send requests to it using the appropriate address.\n\nRemember that by default, the Serve CLI assumes that you're working with a local cluster. However, if the `RAY_AGENT_ADDRESS` environment variable is set, the Serve CLI commands will use that value instead.\n\nTo test your application on a remote cluster, you can use the `serve run` command again, but this time pass the `--address` argument to specify the address of the Ray cluster to connect to. The address for remote clusters has the form `ray://<head-node-ip-address>:10001`.\n\nMake sure to check the Ray Dashboard to verify that it is running and accessible in your local browser. You may need to set the `RAY_ADDRESS` environment variable to the appropriate value, such as `http://127.0.0.1:8265`, to interact with your remote Ray cluster using the Jobs CLI on your local machine."

However, this practice is not recommended unless your log processing tool only captures log records written to stderr.\n\nAdditionally, you can disable the memory monitor by setting the environment variable RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms to zero when starting Ray (e.g., RAY_memory_monitor_refresh_ms=0 ray start ...). This will prevent Ray from raising error messages and taking actions for fault tolerance related to memory usage.\n\nIf you want to disable logging to the driver in large scale runs, you can set log_to_driver=False in ray.init. This will prevent all worker logs from being copied to the driver stdout."

Once you are sure that the detached actor is no longer needed, you can call `ray.kill(actor_handle)` to terminate the actor. This will not go through the normal Python `sys.exit` teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `atexit` will not be called.\n\nIf an actor is misbehaving or causing issues, you can force-kill it by calling `ray.kill` on any handle to the actor. Note that it does not need to be the original handle to the actor. If `max_restarts` is set, you can also allow Ray to automatically restart the actor by passing `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill`.\n\nIf you want to kill actors immediately, you can also call `ray.kill(actor)`.\n\nAdditionally, if necessary, you can manually terminate an actor from within one of the actor methods. This can be done by defining an `exit` method within the actor class and calling `ray.actor.exit_actor()` within that method."

When a remote operation is invoked, it immediately returns a promise/future, which is essentially an identifier (ID) of the operation's result. This allows for parallelism, as multiple operations can be launched in parallel. To retrieve the actual results, the programmer needs to call `ray.get()` on the IDs of the results. This call blocks until the results are available. Additionally, Ray natively integrates with asyncio, allowing it to be used alongside popular async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis."

Additionally, you can manually terminate an actor from within one of the actor methods by calling `ray.actor.exit_actor()`. \n\nIf you have a handle to the actor, you can use `ray.kill(actor_handle)` to kill the actor. However, note that this method will not go through the normal Python sys.exit teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `atexit` will not be called.\n\nAnother way to terminate an actor is by deleting all actor handles to it. When all actor handles to a remote actor in Python are deleted, the actor will be terminated. This will cause the actor to complete any outstanding work and then shut down.\n\nIf an actor is misbehaving or causing issues, you can force-kill it by calling `ray.kill` on any handle to the actor. You can also allow Ray to automatically restart the actor by passing `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill` if `max_restarts` is set.\n\nIt's important to note that if all references to an actor are removed, the actor will be terminated."

Import the necessary modules:\n   ```python\n   from ray import train, tune\n   from ray.tune import Callback\n   ```\n\n2. Define your callback class. For example, here is a simple callback that prints a metric each time a result is received:\n   ```python\n   class MyCallback(Callback):\n       def on_result(self, result):\n           print(\"Received result:\", result)\n   ```\n\n3. In your `train_func` function, create an instance of the Trainer and add the callback using the `add_callback` method:\n   ```python\n   def train_func(config):\n       # ...\n       trainer = transformers.Trainer(...)\n       trainer.add_callback(MyCallback())\n       # ...\n   ```\n\n4. Run your training job using Ray Tune:\n   ```python\n   tune.run(train_func, config=your_config)\n   ```\n\nBy adding the callback to the Trainer, you can report metrics and checkpoints to Ray Tune, enabling fault-tolerant training. Note that the provided `RayTrainReportCallback` is a simple implementation and can be customized further.\n\nAdditionally, you can define a simple grid-search Tune run using a callback like `WandbLoggerCallback` as follows:\n```python\ndef tune_with_callback():\n    tuner = tune.Tuner(\n        train_function,\n        tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(\n            metric=\"loss\",\n            mode=\"min\",\n        ),\n        run_config=train.RunConfig(\n            callbacks=[WandbLoggerCallback(project=\"Wandb_example\")]\n        ),\n        # ...\n    )\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use callbacks in the Trainer with Ray Tune for monitoring and customization purposes during the training process."

This argument specifies the path to the working directory. For example:\n\n```\nray job submit --working-dir your_working_directory -- python script.py\n```\n\nThis is necessary when using remote clusters to upload the working directory to the cluster. However, for local clusters, it is not strictly necessary.\n\nAdditionally, when running `ray.init()`, if a `working_dir` is specified in the runtime environment, the Ray client will upload the working directory on the laptop to `/tmp/ray/session_latest/runtime_resources/_ray_pkg_<hash of directory contents>`.\n\nRay workers are started in the `/tmp/ray/session_latest/runtime_resources/_ray_pkg_<hash of directory contents>` directory on the cluster. This means that relative paths in the remote tasks and actors in the code will work on both the laptop and the cluster without any code changes.\n\nIt is important to note that setting a local directory per-task or per-actor is currently unsupported. The working directory can only be set per-job using `ray.init()`.\n\nThe default session directory for Ray is `/tmp/ray/{ray_session_name}`. You can change the root temporary directory by passing `--temp-dir={your temp path}` to `ray start`.

However, if you prefer to redirect the logs to stderr of the host pods instead, you can set the environment variable `RAY_LOG_TO_STDERR=1` on all Ray nodes. It is worth noting that this practice is not recommended but may be useful if your log processing tool only captures log records written to stderr.\n\nIf you are looking for the `log.info` statements specifically, it is possible that they are not being captured in the Ray logs. It is also mentioned that worker logs of Ray Jobs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while driver logs are not. Driver logs are only captured for Ray Jobs submitted via the Jobs API. You can find the captured driver logs with the Dashboard UI, CLI (using the `ray job logs` command), or the Python SDK (`JobSubmissionClient.get_logs()` or `JobSubmissionClient.tail_job_logs()`).\n\nIn summary, if you cannot see `log.info` in the Ray logs, it could be due to the redirection of logs to stderr or the specific log statements not being captured in the Ray logs."

However, there are a few steps you can follow to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. Make sure you have properly set up port forwarding from your local machine to the head node. If you started your remote cluster with the Ray Cluster Launcher, you can use the \"ray dashboard\" command to automatically set up port forwarding.\n\n2. Check that you can view the Ray Dashboard in your local browser by accessing the URL \"http://127.0.0.1:8265\". Once you have verified this, set the environment variable RAY_ADDRESS to \"http://127.0.0.1:8265\" to interact with your remote Ray cluster using the Jobs CLI on your local machine.\n\n3. Ensure that the Ray Dashboard port is not being blocked by any firewall or security settings. If necessary, configure your firewall to allow access to port 8265.\n\n4. If you are using a different port for the Ray Dashboard, make sure to update the port forwarding configuration accordingly.\n\n5. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, you may need to further investigate the specific configuration of your Ray cluster and the network setup to identify any potential misconfigurations or conflicts.\n\nRemember to exercise caution when exposing the Ray Dashboard publicly without proper authentication in place for security purposes."

Use `ray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:10001\")` (Ray Client) to connect your shell to the cluster. This will allow you to do interactive work. Refer to the section on using Ray Client for more details on setting up your cluster.\n\n3. In the YAML file, specify the node type of the head node as `ray.head.default`.\n\n4. Configure the file mounts in the YAML file to copy the custom PEM file to the head and worker nodes. Use the format `\"/path/on/remote/machine\": \"/path/on/local/machine\"`. For example, you can add the following entry to copy the PEM file: `\"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\": \"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\"`.\n\n5. In the YAML file, under the `auth` section, set the `ssh_user` to the appropriate username (e.g., `ubuntu`).\n\n6. If you already have a private keypair, you can use it by setting the `ssh_private_key` parameter in the `auth` section of the YAML file to the path of your key.pem file.\n\nAlternatively, you can use SSH port forwarding as an alternative approach. Open an SSH connection with your Ray cluster and forward the listening port (10001) using the following commands:\n```\n$ ray up cluster.yaml\n$ ray attach cluster.yaml -p 10001\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `<head_node_host>` with the actual hostname or IP address of your head node."

By default, the GCS is not fault-tolerant, meaning that if it fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault-tolerant, HA Redis is required.\n\nIn the context provided, it is mentioned that the head node of the Ray cluster has memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if the same number of Tasks and Actors are executed from the head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems. To address this, it is recommended not to run any Tasks and Actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node.\n\nAdditionally, it is mentioned that the head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it like GCS. A good starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory, but the actual specification depends on the workload and the size of the cluster.\n\nIf your GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node, it could be due to the nature of the GCS and the cluster-level operations it performs. Tuning the operating system settings to support the number of network connections created by the GCS may help in optimizing memory usage."

Check the logs for any routing issues. Look for error messages like \"This node has an IP address of xx.xx.xx.xx, while we cannot find the matched Raylet address.\" This can occur if you connect the Ray cluster with a different IP address or connect a container. Overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections can also cause this issue. The solution is to start the worker nodes more slowly.\n\n2. If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, use the command `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` to check for errors. Ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough. In production scenarios, it is recommended to use larger Ray pods and size each Ray pod to take up an entire Kubernetes node.\n\n3. Use the command `ray status` to view detailed cluster status. This can help you identify any issues or errors.\n\n4. If the issue persists after waiting for 1 minute, check the logs for the dashboard and dashboard agent. The logs can be found at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/` on the head Pod.\n\n5. If you are running multiple clusters, consider starting a new Ray cluster instead of one large cluster. Running multiple smaller clusters can be more cost-effective and easier to debug.\n\n6. For running large Ray clusters with more than 1k nodes, you may need to tune system settings to enable communication between such a large number of machines. Refer to the configuration guide for more details.\n\n7. Use the command `watch -n 1 kubectl get pod` to continuously monitor the status of the pods.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and debug the issue with the pending nodes in your Ray cluster."

Test that it works by running the necessary commands from your local machine.\n\nOnce your Ray cluster is set up on AWS, you can start using Ray Data. Ray Data has no restrictions on the cloud provider, ML framework, or data format. You can start a Ray cluster on AWS, GCP, or Azure clouds. You can use any ML framework of your choice, such as PyTorch, HuggingFace, or Tensorflow. Ray Data also supports a wide variety of data formats, including CSV, Parquet, and raw images.\n\nTo load a dataset from S3 using Ray Data, you can use the `ray.data.read_images` function. For example, if you want to load the validation set of the Imagenette dataset from an S3 bucket, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\ns3_uri = \"s3://anonymous@air-example-data-2/imagenette2/train/\"\n\nds = ray.data.read_images(s3_uri, mode=\"RGB\")\n```\n\nNote that if you want to run the example on the full LightShot dataset, you need to download and extract the dataset. You can then upload the dataset to S3 using the `aws s3 cp` command."

            "answer": "To avoid shuffling your dataset during a `ray.data.map_batches()` operation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Set a seed for any shuffling operations: You can use the `seed` argument in functions like `random_shuffle()`, `randomize_block_order()`, or `iter_batches()` to ensure reproducibility.\n\n2. Use a small batch size: When calling `ds.map_batches()`, make sure to use a batch size that is small enough for the output batch to comfortably fit into memory. This helps avoid potential out-of-memory situations.\n\n3. Consider using `map_batches()` instead of unvectorized transformations: According to the warning message, the `map`, `flat_map`, and `filter` operations can be slow. If you're using a vectorized transformation, it is recommended to use `.map_batches()` instead.\n\n4. Repartition the dataset: Before mapping batches, you can repartition the dataset into multiple partitions. This ensures that there are enough parallel tasks to take advantage of all available resources. The example mentions using 100 partitions, but you can choose any other number as long as it is more than the number of available resources (e.g., GPUs).\n\n5. Follow best practices for enabling reproducibility: If reproducibility is important for your training framework, make sure to follow the best practices specific to your framework. For example, you can refer to the PyTorch reproducibility guide.\n\nNote that shuffling data can be important for model quality, so consider the trade-off between shuffling and reproducibility based on your specific use case."

By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/.\n\nIf you notice a memory leak on a Serve actor, you can use memray to debug it. First, install memray using pip install memray. Then, set the environment variable RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_MEMORY_PROFILING=1 and run your Serve application. All the Serve actors will run a memray tracker that logs their memory usage to bin files in the /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/ directory. You can generate a flamegraph of the memory usage by running the memray flamegraph [bin file] command. Refer to the memray documentation for more information.\n\nTo access the Ray Dashboard when running Ray Serve locally, you can go to http://localhost:8265 in your browser.

The `compute` argument specifies the `ActorPoolStrategy` with the number of parallel actors. By setting the `compute` argument, you can control the level of parallelism in your task execution.\n\nFor example, if you want to run your class-based UDF with 5 parallel actors, you would set the `compute` argument to 5 when calling the `map_batches` method on the dataset.\n\nHere's an example of how to set the `compute` argument:\n\n```python\ndataset.map_batches(YourClass().your_method, compute=5)\n```\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended to repartition the dataset into multiple partitions before mapping batches to ensure enough parallel tasks to take advantage of all available resources. The number of partitions can be any number greater than the number of available resources in the cluster.\n\nNote: The specific details of setting the maximum parallel concurrent scheduled tasks in `map_batches` may vary depending on the specific implementation and framework being used."

The Ray Autoscaler and the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler complement each other. After the Ray Autoscaler decides to create or delete a Ray pod, the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can provision or clean up the corresponding Kubernetes node."

Increasing this factor amplifies the response of the autoscaling algorithm, allowing for faster resource scaling.\n\nOn the other hand, the `downscale_smoothing_factor` is used to slow down the pace of downscaling.

            "answer": "The reasons for spikes in node CPU utilization can vary based on the context provided. Here are some possible reasons:\n\n1. Bottlenecked by object store memory: Adding more CPU-only nodes to the cluster increases total cluster object store memory, allowing more data to be buffered between preprocessing and training stages.\n\n2. Insufficient bandwidth on the head node: The head node may experience high CPU usage due to outbound bandwidth limitations. It is recommended to ensure that the head node has sufficient bandwidth, especially for large clusters.\n\n3. High latency and low throughput for requests: Performance issues such as high latency and low throughput may cause spikes in CPU utilization. Monitoring with Ray and Ray Serve can help identify these issues, which may appear as constant serve_num_router_requests and spiking serve_deployment_processing_latency_ms. Using the right hardware and resources is important to address these issues.\n\n4. Bottlenecked by preprocessing compute time: If the bottleneck is preprocessing compute time, adding more CPU-only nodes with additional CPU cores can parallelize preprocessing and improve performance. If preprocessing is still not fast enough to saturate GPUs, adding enough CPU-only nodes to cache the preprocessed dataset can help.\n\n5. Insufficient computing resources in the Kubernetes cluster: If the Kubernetes cluster does not have enough computing resources, the GKE Autopilot may add a new Kubernetes node to the cluster. This process may take a few minutes, causing some Pods to be pending and potentially impacting CPU utilization.\n\n6. Linux Out of Memory killer or Ray Memory Monitor: Processes with high memory usage may be killed by the Linux Out of Memory killer or Ray Memory Monitor to avoid out-of-memory situations. Additionally, system instability or overload can lead to CPU spikes and failures.\n\nIt is also mentioned that the choice of CPU type and the number of CPUs/GPUs should be considered based on the specific requirements of the application."

This error typically occurs when the worker node is unable to connect to the head node.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the head node is running: Ensure that the head node is up and running without any issues. Inspect the log directory `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/` in the head Pod for any errors related to the GCS server.\n\n2. Verify the Ray version: Make sure that the Ray version running on the specified address matches the version expected by the worker node. If there is a version mismatch, it can cause connection issues.\n\n3. Verify the IP address: Double-check that the IP address provided is correct. If the worker node cannot access the specified IP address, it will fail to connect. You can use the command `ip route get xx.xx.xx.xx` on the worker node to debug any routing issues.\n\n4. Check firewall settings: Ensure that there are no firewall settings preventing access to the specified IP address. Firewall rules can sometimes block the connection between the worker and head nodes.\n\nIf the above troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issue, you can refer to the KubeRay documentation on GCS Fault Tolerance for a more detailed guide on resolving this problem."

Increase the capacity of the object store: Objects are spilled to external storage when the capacity of the object store is used up. By increasing the capacity, you can reduce the likelihood of objects getting spilled.\n\n2. Optimize memory usage: Minimize the memory usage of your distributed applications to avoid filling up the object store prematurely. This can be achieved by avoiding multiple copies of the same object in the object store.\n\n3. Use high-performance storage: If possible, use NVMe SSDs or other high-performance storage options. This can help improve the performance of object spilling if it becomes necessary.\n\n4. Monitor and analyze object spilling: Ray provides stats and logs related to object spilling. You can monitor the raylet logs to see when spilling is happening and view cluster-wide spill stats using the \"ray memory\" command. This can help you understand the impact of object spilling on your application's performance.\n\nBy implementing these measures, you can minimize the occurrence of object spilling and optimize the performance of your distributed applications."

If you are running KubeRay, you can execute the following command to get the list of pods:\n\n```\nkubectl get pods\n```\n\nOnce you have identified the pod of the replica you want to kill, you can execute the appropriate command to kill it. If you are running Ray, you can use the `ray summary actors` command to get information about the actors, including their process ID (PID)."
