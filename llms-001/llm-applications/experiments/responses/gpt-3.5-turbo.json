            ],
            "answer": "When using Ray Data type conversions with `map_batches`, there are a few things to keep in mind. \n\nFirst, Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default. To configure the batch type, you can specify the `batch_format` parameter in `map_batches()`. You can return either format (NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames) from your function.\n\nIf you encounter potential out-of-memory situations, make sure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large. Additionally, always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough so that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\n\nTo transform batches with tasks, you can call `map_batches()`. Ray Data uses tasks by default. Here's an example of increasing the brightness of images in a batch using tasks:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness)\n)\n```\n\nYou can also specify the batch format in methods like `Dataset.iter_batches()` and `Dataset.map_batches()` to specify the batch type. For example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\ndataset = ray.data.range(10)\nnext(iter(dataset.iter_batches(batch_format=\"numpy\", batch_size=5)))\n# Output: {'id': array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])}\n\nnext(iter(dataset.iter_batches(batch_format=\"pandas\", batch_size=5)))\n# Output:\n#    id\n# 0   0\n# 1   1\n# 2   2\n# 3   3\n# 4   4\n```\n\nWhen using Torch tensors, transformations applied with `map` or `map_batches` can return Torch tensors. However, under the hood, Ray Data automatically converts Torch tensors to NumPy arrays. Subsequent transformations accept NumPy arrays as input, not Torch tensors.\n\nIf your tensors vary in shape, Ray Data represents batches as arrays of object dtype. The individual elements of these object arrays are regular ndarrays."

            "answer": "In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically adjusting the number of replicas for a deployment based on its load. The Ray Serve autoscaler, which is an application-level autoscaler, interacts with the Ray Autoscaler to start or stop replica actors based on the demand for requests. If there are not enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod in Kubernetes, scales the cluster up by increasing the number of worker nodes when the resource demands exceed the current capacity. Conversely, it removes idle worker nodes from the cluster. The autoscaler can be configured using the Ray cluster launcher or on Kubernetes using the Ray autoscaler. It is important to note that Ray Serve Autoscaling allows the minimum number of replicas to be set to 0, and the scale-up process starts when traffic is received. However, there may be a cold start time as the Ray ServeHandle waits for available replicas to assign the request. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. For more information on autoscaling, refer to the user guides for Ray clusters on VMs and Kubernetes."

            "answer": "If you use AsyncIO's `await` to wait for a Ray future like `await x.remote()`, it will fail because Ray does not support asyncio for remote tasks. Instead, you can wrap the async function with a wrapper to run the task synchronously. For example:\n\n```python\nasync def f():\n    pass\n\n@ray.remote\ndef wrapper():\n    import asyncio\n    asyncio.run(f())\n```\n\nHowever, ObjectRefs can be translated to asyncio.Futures, allowing you to await on Ray futures in existing concurrent applications. Instead of using `ray.get(some_task.remote())` or `ray.wait([some_task.remote()])`, you can do the following:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_task():\n    return 1\n\nasync def await_obj_ref():\n    await some_task.remote()\n    await asyncio.wait([some_task.remote()])\n```\n\nYou can also refer to the asyncio documentation for more asyncio patterns, including timeouts and asyncio.gather. If you need to directly access the future object, you can call:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def convert_to_asyncio_future():\n    ref = some_task.remote()\n    fut: asyncio.Future = asyncio.wrap_future(ref.future())\n    print(await fut)\n\nasyncio.run(convert_to_asyncio_future())\n```\n\nNote that `ray.wait()` returns two lists of object references, one with finished tasks we're waiting for and one with unfinished tasks. However, this method will issue a warning if it's running inside an async context. Instead of `ray.wait(object_refs)`, you can use `await asyncio.wait(object_refs)`.\n\nIn summary, while Ray natively integrates with asyncio and you can use Ray alongside popular async frameworks, you cannot directly use `await` with Ray futures. Instead, you need to wrap the async function or use asyncio features to await on Ray futures."

It works with any model packaging and registry format, providing key features for building production-ready machine learning applications, including autoscaling and integration with business logic. Ray Serve supports multi-model composition using a programmable API, where calls to different models look like function calls. It allows models to use different resources and run across different machines in the cluster. \n\nUsing containers alone can be limiting and hard to work with. Ray Serve, on the other hand, provides a flexible and scalable serving layer that is not tied to any specific machine learning library or framework.

Write your LLM application as a single Python module, combining prompt preprocessing, vector database lookups, LLM API calls, and response validation.\n2. Install Ray Serve and set up a Ray cluster, either locally or on a remote, multi-node cluster using the Ray Cluster Launcher.\n3. Use the Ray Serve CLI to deploy your application. The command `serve deploy` takes a config file path and deploys it to the Ray cluster over HTTP. You can specify the path to your config file in the command.\n4. Configure your deployment using Ray Serve. You can scale out by increasing the number of deployment replicas and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs.\n5. Check the status of your Serve application in production by inspecting it. You can use the Ray agent address variable in your environment to ensure you're using the desired Ray agent address.\n6. Make heavyweight code updates, such as runtime_env changes, by starting a new Ray Cluster, updating your Serve config file, and deploying the file with `serve deploy` to the new cluster. Once the new deployment is finished, switch your traffic to the new cluster.\n\nDeployments are the central concept in Ray Serve. They contain the business logic or ML model to handle incoming requests and can be scaled up across a Ray cluster. Each deployment consists of replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down to match the incoming request load."

To deal with this issue, the example suggests using DeepSpeed, a library that optimizes the training process and reduces GRAM usage.

            "answer": "To quickly narrow down the root cause of a failed Ray job, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the job logs: Ray applications are usually run as Ray Jobs. Worker logs of Ray Jobs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while Driver logs are not. If the Ray Job was submitted via the Jobs API, you can find the captured Driver logs with the Dashboard UI, CLI (using the `ray job logs` command), or the Python SDK (`JobSubmissionClient.get_logs()` or `JobSubmissionClient.tail_job_logs()`).\n\n2. Use the `ray logs` command: You can use the `ray logs` command to get logs based on the filename (cluster) or resource identifiers (actor). For example, you can use `ray logs cluster` to get all the log files available on a node. You can also specify a specific log file and tail a certain number of lines using the `--tail` option. For example, `ray logs cluster raylet.out --tail 500` will print the last 500 lines of `raylet.out` on a head node. You can also use `ray logs` as an alias for `ray logs cluster`.\n\n3. Check the output of the Ray job using `kubectl logs`: If you are using Kubernetes to run your Ray job, you can use the `kubectl logs -l=job-name=rayjob-sample` command to check the output of the Ray job.\n\n4. Check the Driver logs: If the Ray Job is submitted by the Job API, the Job logs are available from the Dashboard. The log file follows the format: `job-driver-<job_submission_id>.log`. However, if you execute the Driver directly on the Head Node of the Ray Cluster or run with Ray Client, the Driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, you can see the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output to view the Driver logs.\n\n5. Check Task and Actor Logs (Worker logs): Task and Actor logs can provide useful information for troubleshooting Ray applications. You can use the `ray logs actor` command to follow the log file with an actor ID, or use the `ray logs task` command to get the stderr generated by a task. Note that if a task is from a concurrent actor (i.e., an async actor or a threaded actor), the logs of the tasks may be interleaved, so it's recommended to use `ray logs actor --id` for the entire actor log.\n\nRemember that Ray does not provide a native storage solution for log data, so you need to manage the lifecycle of the logs yourself."

To tolerate head node failures, it is necessary to make the Global Control Store (GCS) fault tolerant so that when a new head node is started, all the cluster-level data is still available.\n\n2. Worker node failure: Worker nodes can fail due to various reasons. This can be simulated by killing the worker pod or the worker node. When a worker node fails, it can impact tasks, actors, and objects running on that node.\n\n3. Overloading the head node: If the head node is overloaded with too many simultaneous connections, it can lead to failures. This can be resolved by starting the worker nodes more slowly.\n\n4. Temporary directories: Temporary directories on the nodes may get cleared up whenever the machines reboot. This can result in the loss of log files when the cluster or some of the nodes are stopped or terminated.

This function allows you to request a specific number of resources (worker nodes) for your cluster.\n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Connect to the Ray cluster\nray.init(address=\"auto\")\n\n# Request a target size for the cluster\ntarget_size = 10  # Set your desired target size here\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(num_cpus=target_size)\n\n# Wait for the cluster to scale up to the target size\nray.autoscaler.sdk.wait_for_nodes(target_size)\n```\n\nBy calling `ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources` with the desired number of CPUs (`num_cpus`), you can request the cluster to scale up to the specified target size immediately. Then, you can use `ray.autoscaler.sdk.wait_for_nodes` to wait for the cluster to reach the target size before proceeding with your tasks.\n\nNote that this method bypasses the autoscaler and directly requests the desired number of resources, so you need to ensure that your cluster has enough available resources to accommodate the requested size."

            "answer": "In the context of Ray datasets, a batch size refers to the number of data points used to compute and apply one gradient update to the model weights during model training. It is a user-facing object that represents a collection of data points.\n\nOn the other hand, a block is an internal abstraction and a processing unit of data. Ray Data partitions rows into distributed data blocks, allowing it to perform operations in parallel. Each block contains a disjoint subset of rows, and Ray Data loads and transforms these blocks in parallel.\n\nWhile a batch is a user-facing object, a block is an internal abstraction used by Ray Data. A dataset operates over a sequence of Ray object references to blocks. The dataset parallelism determines the number of blocks the base data is split into for parallel reads. The higher the parallelism, the smaller the data blocks in the dataset, which provides more opportunities for parallel execution.\n\nIt is important to note that large block sizes can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, it is recommended to ensure that no single item in the Ray Data is too large and to use a small enough batch size when calling `ds.map_batches()` to ensure that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\n\nIn summary, a batch is a user-facing object representing a collection of data points, while a block is an internal abstraction used by Ray Data to partition and process data in parallel."

Runtime environments in Ray allow you to set up dependencies for your Ray application. These dependencies can include files, packages, environment variables, and more.\n\n5. There are two ways to set up dependencies in Ray:\n   - Prepare your dependencies on the cluster in advance using the Ray Cluster Launcher. You can build all your files and dependencies into a container image and specify it in your Cluster YAML Configuration. Alternatively, you can install packages using `setup_commands` in the Ray Cluster configuration file.\n   - Install dependencies dynamically while Ray is running using runtime environments.\n\n6. To use runtime environments, make sure you have Ray 1.4.0 or later installed. Runtime environments are currently supported on macOS and Linux, with beta support on Windows.\n\nFor more detailed information on setting up environment dependencies and using the Ray Cluster Launcher, you can refer to the Ray User Guide."

If you need to mutate the array, you can manually copy it at the destination using the `arr.copy()` method. This effectively disables the zero-copy deserialization feature provided by Ray.\n\n2. If your function does not mutate its input, you can set the `zero_copy_batch` parameter to `True` to improve performance and decrease memory utilization. This can be done by passing `zero_copy_batch=True` when calling the `map_batches()` function.\n\n3. When invoking a function that requires the array, you can explicitly call `ray.put(a)` to avoid copying the array every time. Then, pass the ID of the array to the function.\n\nBy following these steps, you can make use of the zero-copy feature provided by Ray for numpy arrays."

            "answer": "The advantages of using a singleton actor include:\n\n1. Efficient resource utilization: Using a singleton actor allows for reusing model initialization for multiple tasks, resulting in more efficient resource utilization. This means that the node will spend more time on the actual workload.\n\n2. Flexible task scheduling: By using a singleton actor, all the required actors and other defined tasks can run concurrently. This provides more flexibility in task scheduling.\n\n3. Stateful operations: Actors can hold global state using instance variables, allowing for easy modification and access to the state. This is particularly useful when stateful operations are required.\n\nThe disadvantages of using a singleton actor include:\n\n1. Limited use cases: If the stateful part of an actor is not needed, it is generally more efficient to use tasks instead. This implies that singleton actors may not be suitable for all scenarios.\n\n2. Lack of support for class variables: Using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported in singleton actors. Each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, resulting in each actor having its own copy of the class variables.\n\n3. Alternative concurrency options: Threaded actors can also be used to achieve concurrency, providing an alternative option to singleton actors.\n\nOverall, the decision to use a singleton actor should be based on the specific requirements of the application and the need for stateful operations."

Retrieval from any job in the Ray cluster: By giving an actor a unique name within its namespace, you can retrieve the actor from any job in the Ray cluster. This is useful when you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it or when you want to access an actor launched by another driver.\n\n2. Flexible scheduling: Using named actors allows tasks to be scheduled more flexibly. This means that both all of your needed actors can run and any other tasks you define can run concurrently.\n\n3. Efficient resource utilization: If you don't need the stateful part of an actor, it is generally better to use tasks. This is because tasks do not have the overhead of maintaining actor state, resulting in more efficient resource utilization.\n\n4. Reusability: Actor-based approaches are more efficient because they reuse model initialization for many tasks. This means that the node will spend more time on the actual workload, improving overall efficiency.\n\nNote that an actor can be named but not detached. If only the name is specified without specifying lifetime=\"detached\", the actor can only be retrieved as long as the original driver is still running."

Move the data loader to the training function: The warning message suggests that the actor TrainTrainable is very large. Check if its definition is implicitly capturing a large array or object in scope. To resolve this, you can use ray.put() to put large objects in the Ray object store.\n\n2. Check the batch size: Another warning message states that to ensure full parallelization across an actor pool of size 4, the specified batch size should be at most 5. If your configured batch size for this operator is 16, you should reduce it to a value that allows full parallelization, such as 5.\n\n3. Use GPUs for inference: If you have access to large GPUs and want to use them for inference, you can make the following changes to your code:\n   - Update the class implementation to move the model and data to and from the GPU.\n   - Specify num_gpus=1 in the ds.map_batches() call to indicate that each actor should use 1 GPU.\n   - Specify a batch_size for inference. Refer to the documentation for more details on configuring the batch size.\n\n4. Transform batches with actors: If you want to transform batches with actors, you can follow these steps:\n   - Implement a class that performs setup in __init__ and transforms data in __call__.\n   - Create an ActorPoolStrategy and configure the number of concurrent workers. Each worker will transform a partition of data.\n   - Call map_batches() and pass your ActorPoolStrategy to compute.\n\nMake sure to review and modify your code accordingly based on these suggestions to resolve the ValueError."

Install the necessary packages: Make sure you have Ray Train and TensorFlow installed. You can install them using the following command:\n   ```\n   pip install -U \"ray[train]\" tensorflow\n   ```\n\n2. Set up your dataset and model: Import the necessary libraries and define your dataset and model using TensorFlow and Keras.\n\n3. Convert Ray Data dataset shard to TensorFlow dataset: In your training function, you may need to convert your Ray Data dataset shard to a TensorFlow dataset so that you can use the Keras API for model training.\n\n4. Use Ray Train to set up multi-worker training: Create a `TorchTrainer` object and pass your training function to it. Set the `scaling_config` parameter to specify the number of workers you want to use. You can also set the `use_gpu` parameter to `True` if you want to use GPU training.\n\n5. Fit the trainer: Call the `fit()` method on the trainer object to start the distributed training process. This will distribute the training across the specified number of workers.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom ray import train\nfrom ray.train.tensorflow import prepare_dataset_shard\n\n# Set up your dataset and model\n# ...\n\n# Convert Ray Data dataset shard to TensorFlow dataset\ndef train_func_distributed(config):\n    dataset = prepare_dataset_shard(config[\"dataset\"])\n    # ...\n\n# Use Ray Train to set up multi-worker training\nuse_gpu = False\ntrainer = TorchTrainer(\n    train_func_distributed,\n    scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=4, use_gpu=use_gpu)\n)\n\n# Fit the trainer\nresults = trainer.fit()\n```\n\nNote that this is a general guide and may need to be adapted to your specific use case."

Define a function to process each file. This function should be decorated with `@ray.remote` to make it a Ray remote function. Inside this function, you can write the code to read and process the data from each file.\n\n3. Use Ray Data operations to load and preprocess the data in a streaming fashion. Ray Data provides flexible and performant APIs for distributed data processing, such as simple transformations like `map_batches()`, global and grouped aggregations like `groupby()`, and shuffling operations like `random_shuffle()`, `sort()`, and `repartition()`.\n\n4. Iterate over your files and call the remote processing function on each file using `ray.remote().remote(file)`. This will distribute the processing of files across the available Ray nodes.\n\nHere's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Assume this Ray node has 16 CPUs and 16G memory.\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\ndef process(file):\n    # Actual work is reading the file and processing the data.\n    # Assume it needs to use 2G memory.\n    pass\n\n# Iterate over your files and call the remote processing function on each file.\nfile_list = [...]  # List of file paths\nresult_ids = [process.remote(file) for file in file_list]\n\n# Wait for all processing tasks to complete\nray.get(result_ids)\n```\n\nNote that Ray Data is particularly suited for offline batch inference and data preprocessing and ingest for ML training. It provides a wide range of preprocessing operations for transforming your data prior to training. However, for unstructured data, it is recommended to use existing Ray Data operations instead of preprocessors. For more details and examples, you can refer to the Ray Data documentation."

            "answer": "To get your project files on the cluster when using Ray Serve, you can use the `serve deploy` command with the `--address` argument. The `serve deploy` command deploys your Serve application to a remote Ray cluster over HTTP. The `--address` argument allows you to specify the remote Ray cluster's dashboard agent address.\n\nThe address should be in the format: [RAY_CLUSTER_URI]:[DASHBOARD_AGENT_PORT]. For example, if the address for the remote cluster is http://127.0.0.1:52365, you can deploy to this address using the command:\n\n```\nserve deploy config_file.yaml -a http://127.0.0.1:52365\n```\n\nMake sure you have set the environment variable `RAY_ADDRESS` to \"http://127.0.0.1:8265\" and that you can view the Ray Dashboard in your local browser at http://127.0.0.1:8265.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `serve run` command to run and test your application easily, either locally or on a remote cluster. For example, you can run the following command to connect to a remote cluster via Ray Client, upload the specified working directory, and run your Serve application:\n\n```\nserve run --address=ray://<head-node-ip-address>:10001 --working-dir=\"./project/src\" local_dev:graph\n```\n\nIn this command, the `working_dir` directory should contain `local_dev.py` so that it can be uploaded to the cluster and imported by Ray Serve. Once the application is up and running, you can send requests to it using `curl`.\n\nRemember to replace `<head-node-ip-address>` with the actual IP address of the head node of your remote cluster."

This ensures safety and isolation. You can use the `ray.init()` function with appropriate parameters, such as `num_cpus` and `num_gpus`, to initialize a new cluster for each test.\n\n2. Tip 3 suggests creating a mini-cluster using `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster`. This allows you to have more control over the cluster configuration and resources during testing.\n\n3. Tip 4 advises caution when running tests in parallel. Parallel execution of tests can introduce concurrency issues, so make sure to handle synchronization and resource sharing appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions reusing a Ray cluster across tests for speed improvements. This approach is described in the context as starting the cluster once for the entire test suite or module. This can be achieved by using the `setUpClass` method in a test class and initializing the Ray cluster there.\n\nIt's important to note that the provided context includes code snippets in different programming languages (Python and Java).

            "answer": "To kill a detached actor in Ray, you can use the `ray.kill(actor)` function. Detached actors are not automatically garbage-collected by Ray, so they must be manually destroyed once they are no longer needed. After calling `ray.kill(actor)`, the actor's name may be reused.\n\nIf you want to allow Ray to automatically restart the actor, you can pass `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill(actor)`.\n\nYou can also manually terminate an actor from within one of its methods by calling `ray.actor.exit_actor()`. This will kill the actor process and release associated resources.\n\nIf an actor is misbehaving or hanging, you can recover from the failure by calling `ray.kill` on any handle to the actor. Note that it does not need to be the original handle to the actor. If `max_restarts` is set, you can allow Ray to automatically restart the actor by passing `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill(actor)`.\n\nHere is an example of manually terminating an actor using an actor handle:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\n\nPlease note that the provided information is specific to Ray and may not apply to other frameworks or languages."

            ],
            "answer": "Ray works with async.io by allowing the invocation of every remote operation to be asynchronous. When a remote operation is called, it immediately returns a promise/future, which is an identifier (ID) of the operation's result. This allows for parallelism, as multiple operations can be launched in parallel. To retrieve the actual results, the programmer needs to call `ray.get()` on the IDs of the results, which blocks until the results are available.\n\nRay natively integrates with asyncio, which is a concurrent programming framework in Python. This means that Ray can be used alongside popular async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. Ray also enables arbitrary functions to be executed asynchronously on separate Python workers, which are called \"tasks\". These tasks can specify their resource requirements in terms of CPUs, GPUs, and custom resources, and the cluster scheduler distributes the tasks across the cluster for parallelized execution.\n\nIt's important to note that running blocking `ray.get()` or `ray.wait()` inside an async actor method is not allowed, as it would block the execution of the event loop. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time, although tasks can be multiplexed. If a threadpool is desired, Threaded Actors can be used.\n\nThe Ray Client can be used to interact with RayServe, a framework for serving Python functions as web services. RayServeSyncHandle blocks the current thread until the request is matched to a replica, while RayServeHandle returns an asyncio.Task upon submission, which can be awaited to resolve to a ray.ObjectRef. This allows for concurrent processing of requests while the current request is buffered.\n\nOverall, Ray provides a way to work with async.io by enabling asynchronous remote operations, integrating with asyncio, and allowing for parallel execution of tasks."

            "answer": "To debug a hanging `ray.get()` call, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure you have reproduced the issue locally.\n2. Check if you are calling `ray.get()` too early. It is best practice to wait as long as possible before calling `ray.get()`, or even design your program to avoid calling it altogether.\n3. Avoid calling `ray.get()` in a loop, as it is a blocking call and will wait until the requested result is available. This can harm parallelism and prevent the loop from continuing until the call to `ray.get()` is resolved.\n4. Separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. This allows all remote functions to be spawned before waiting for the results, enabling them to run in parallel in the background.\n5. Instead of calling `ray.get()` one by one, you can pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` to wait for all tasks to finish.\n6. If you don't need to manipulate the object, consider whether calling `ray.get()` on it is necessary. When `ray.get()` is called, objects must be transferred to the worker/node that calls it, so unnecessary calls can harm performance.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to debug and optimize your `ray.get()` calls."

However, note that atexit handlers installed in the actor will not be run.\n\nAlternatively, you can manually terminate an actor from within one of its methods by calling `ray.actor.exit_actor()`. This will kill the actor process and release associated resources.\n\nIf you want to let pending tasks finish before killing the actor, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead. This will queue a termination task and run any atexit handlers installed in the actor.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that an actor will be terminated automatically when all copies of the actor handle have gone out of scope in Python or if the original creator process dies."

            "answer": "To specify that you want a task to run on a V100 GPU type, you can use the `num_gpus` parameter in the `ray.remote()` decorator. For example, in Python, you can use `@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)` to specify that the task requires 1 GPU. Ray will then schedule the task to a node that has enough free GPU resources and assign a GPU to the task by setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable before running the task code.\n\nIn the provided context, there are several examples of specifying GPU resources:\n\n1. In C++, you can use `ray::Task(MyFunction).SetResource(\"GPU\", 2.0).Remote()` to specify that the task requires 2.0 GPU resources.\n2. In Python, you can use `@ray.remote(num_gpus=0.5)` to specify that the actor requires 0.5 GPU resources.\n3. In C++, you can use `ray::Task(MyFunction).SetResource(\"GPU\", 1.0).Remote()` to specify that the task requires 1.0 GPU resources.\n4. In Python, you can use `ray.init(num_gpus=2)` to specify that the Ray cluster has 2 GPUs available.\n5. In Python, you can use `@ray.remote(num_gpus=1, max_calls=1, num_returns=2)` to specify that the task requires 1 GPU and can be called only once.\n\nRemember to adjust the `num_gpus` parameter according to the specific GPU type you want to use, such as `num_gpus=1` for a single V100 GPU."

Start by reading the \"RayCluster Quickstart\" guide, which provides an overview of managing and interacting with Ray clusters on Kubernetes.\n\n2. Next, refer to the \"RayCluster Configuration\" guide, which covers the key aspects of Ray cluster configuration on Kubernetes.\n\n3. Deployments of Ray on Kubernetes follow the operator pattern. The main components involved are a custom resource called a RayCluster, which describes the desired state of the Ray cluster, and a custom controller called the KubeRay operator, which manages Ray pods to match the RayCluster's specification.\n\n4. To deploy a Ray cluster, create a RayCluster custom resource (CR) using the command: `kubectl apply -f raycluster.yaml`. This guide provides more details on configuring the RayCluster CR.\n\n5. The Ray Dashboard is an important tool for monitoring and debugging Ray applications and clusters. The guide \"Configuring and Managing Ray Dashboard\" explains how to configure Ray Dashboard on your clusters. Note that the configurations may vary depending on whether you launch a local Ray cluster or use KubeRay. Integrations with Prometheus and Grafana are optional for an enhanced Dashboard experience.\n\n6. The RayService provides Kubernetes-native support for Ray clusters and Ray Serve applications. You can define a Ray cluster and its Ray Serve applications using a Kubernetes config and then use `kubectl` to create the cluster and applications. In-place updates for Ray Serve applications are also possible by updating the RayService CR config and using `kubectl apply`.\n\n7. The RayJob provides Kubernetes-native support for Ray clusters and Ray jobs. You can define a Ray cluster and job using a Kubernetes config and create them using `kubectl`. The cluster can be automatically deleted once the job is finished.\n\n8. Finally, to deploy the Ray cluster, use the provided configuration file and apply it using the appropriate command. The recommended configuration is to schedule one Ray pod per 16-CPU Kubernetes node, but it is not required. Using a few large Ray pods is generally more efficient than many small ones.\n\nPlease refer to the specific guides mentioned in the context for more detailed instructions on each step."

This can be done by adjusting the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.\n\nFor more information on configuring autoscaling with Ray, you can refer to the Ray Autoscaler documentation. There is also ongoing work to improve Ray's scalability and stability, so you can share your thoughts and use cases with the Ray team.\n\nIf you are using Kubernetes, there is a guide available on how to configure the Ray autoscaler on Kubernetes. The Ray autoscaler on Kubernetes adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on resource demand.\n\nOverall, Ray is an open-source, Python-based distributed computing library that enables ML engineers and Python developers to scale Python applications and accelerate machine learning workloads.

Here are some possible explanations and solutions:\n\n1. Port Forwarding: When tunneling the dashboard port from the head node to your machine, make sure that the port forwarding is correctly set up. Double-check the port number and ensure that it is being forwarded to the correct IP address and port on your local machine.\n\n2. Authentication: The context mentions that exposing the Ray Dashboard publicly without proper authentication is not recommended for security purposes. Make sure that you have the necessary authentication mechanisms in place before exposing the dashboard.\n\n3. Customizing the Dashboard Port: By default, the Ray Dashboard runs on port 8265 of the head node. If you need to customize the port, follow the instructions provided in the context to pass the appropriate arguments or keyword arguments when starting the cluster explicitly with CLI or implicitly with `ray.init()`.\n\n4. Dependencies and Availability: Ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies for the Ray Dashboard, including the full installation of Ray using `pip install \"ray[default]\"`. Also, make sure that the dashboard component is included when starting the Ray cluster, as it is the default behavior for `ray start` and `ray.init()`.\n\n5. Log Files: If you encounter any issues with the Ray Dashboard, you can check the dashboard log at `<RAY_LOG_DIR>/dashboard.log`, which is usually located at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/dashboard.log`. This can provide more in-depth information for debugging purposes.\n\n6. Accessibility and Dependencies: When running on a remote cluster, ensure that the import path is accessible.

This can be done by specifying the `working_dir` parameter when initializing Ray workers. The `working_dir` can be a local existing directory with a total size of up to 100 MiB, a local existing zipped file with a total unzipped size of up to 100 MiB, or a URI to a remotely-stored zip file containing the working directory for your job.\n\n2. If you want to disable the behavior of changing the working directory, you can set the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR` environment variable to 0. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes. Make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\n3. The working directory of the Trainable worker will be automatically changed to the corresponding Trial directory. This means that you don't need to worry about multiple workers saving to the same location. You can access relative file paths in your Tune training function.\n\n4. If you want to write to a file directly, you can use the `open` function and specify the file path relative to the trial directory. For example:\n\n```python\nwith open(f\"./artifact_{self.iteration}.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(\"Artifact Data\")\n```\n\n5. If you need to move files manually or upload files from a local path, you can use the `ray rsync-up` command. For example:\n\n```bash\nray rsync-up lm-cluster.yaml PATH/TO/LM '~/efs/lm'\n```\n\nThis command will upload files from the local path to the specified destination.\n\nNote: The provided information is based on the context provided and may vary depending on the specific use case or framework being used."

            "answer": "The GCS server, or Global Control Service server, is responsible for managing cluster-level metadata and performing cluster-level operations such as actor, placement group, and node management. By default, the GCS server is not fault-tolerant as it stores all data in-memory, and its failure results in the failure of the entire Ray cluster. To make the GCS server fault-tolerant, HA Redis (High Availability Redis) is required.\n\nIf your GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node, it could be because the head node has more memory-demanding system components like the GCS server or the dashboard. Additionally, if the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and you execute the same number of tasks and actors from the head node, it can easily experience out-of-memory problems. To mitigate this, you can avoid running any tasks and actors on the head node by specifying \"--num-cpus=0\" when starting the head node using \"ray start --head\".\n\nIt is also important to tune the operating system settings to support the large number of network connections created when all nodes and workers connect to the GCS server.\n\nWhen deploying a large cluster, the head node may experience extra stress due to additional system processes like the GCS server. A recommended starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory, although the actual specification depends on the workload and cluster size.\n\nIn summary, the GCS server manages cluster-level metadata and operations, and if it is taking up a lot of memory on the head node, it could be due to the nature of its functions and the configuration of the cluster."

            "answer": "To debug the issue of pending nodes when starting a cluster with Ray up, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check the logs for any routing issues. Look for error messages like \"This node has an IP address of xx.xx.xx.xx, while we cannot find the matched Raylet address.\" This can occur if you connect the Ray cluster with a different IP address or connect a container. It may also be caused by overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections. The solution is to start the worker nodes more slowly.\n\n2. Ensure that the Ray cluster is already started. If it is, you should not need to run anything on the worker nodes.\n\n3. If your program freezes, you can restart the Ray cluster without running any installation commands by using the following command: `$ ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n\n4. Wait for a while after all nodes have started. If necessary, you can forcefully kill a random node using the command `ray kill-random-node tune-default.yaml --hard`. This will cause Tune to continue the trials on a different worker node. You can also specify a storage path as part of `air.RunConfig` to upload results to cloud storage like S3, allowing you to persist results in case you want to start and stop your cluster automatically.\n\n5. If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can use `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` to check for errors. Make sure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough. In production scenarios, it is recommended to use larger Ray pods and size each Ray pod to take up an entire Kubernetes node.\n\n6. If you are running a large Ray cluster with more than 1k nodes, you may need to tune system settings to enable communication between such a large number of machines. Refer to the configuration guide for more details.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug the issue of pending nodes when starting a Ray cluster with Ray up."

You can parse these stored logs with a logging stack such as ELK or Loki to be able to search by deployment or replica. Serve also supports log rotation of these logs through setting the environment variables RAY_ROTATION_MAX_BYTES and RAY_ROTATION_BACKUP_COUNT.\n\nTo troubleshoot application deployment failures in Serve, you can check the Kuberay operator logs by running kubectl logs -f <kuberay-operator-pod-name>. The Kuberay operator logs contain information about the Serve application deployment event and Serve application health checks.\n\nYou can also use the Ray dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application's states. This includes details such as the number of deployment replicas currently running, logs for your Serve controller, deployment replicas, and proxies, and the Ray nodes running in your Ray cluster. The Ray dashboard can be accessed at port 8265 at your cluster's URI.\n\nFor more visibility into the applications running on the cluster, you can go to the Ray Serve dashboard at http://localhost:8265/#/serve.

However, please note that this method cannot be used if `reuse_actors` is set to True in `tune.TuneConfig()`, as it will raise a ValueError in that case.\n\nTo implement checkpoint loading, you can use the `train.get_checkpoint()` function. This function will be populated with a trial's latest checkpoint whenever Tune restores a trial. This can happen when a trial is configured to retry after encountering a failure, when the experiment is being restored, or when the trial is being resumed after a pause (e.g., PBT).\n\nPlease note that the `checkpoint_frequency` and `checkpoint_at_end` parameters will not work with Function API checkpointing.\n\nIf you ran your initial experiment with cloud checkpointing, you will need to download all the checkpoints to analyze them. The storage path for the checkpoints is specified in the `run_config` parameter of `tune.Tuner()`. In the provided example, the storage path is set to \"s3://my-checkpoints-bucket/path/\". You can use the appropriate method or library to download the checkpoints from the specified cloud storage location.\n\nFor more information on saving and loading trial checkpoints in Tune, you can refer to the \"How to Save and Load Trial Checkpoints\" guide in the Tune Feature Guides."

The head node performs health checks on Grafana on the backend.\n\n2. `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST`: Set this variable to an address that the head node can use to access Prometheus.\n\nTo set these variables more intelligently, considering that the head node IP changes every time the cluster is reconfigured, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. Set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to the IP address of the head node and the port on which Grafana is hosted. For example, if the IP of the head node is 55.66.77.88 and Grafana is hosted on port 3000, set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` as `http://55.66.77.88:3000`.\n\n2. Set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to the address of the Prometheus server that the head node can access.\n\nAdditionally, if you use a different Prometheus server for each Ray Cluster but use the same Grafana server for all clusters, you can set the `RAY_PROMETHEUS_NAME` environment variable to different values for each Ray Cluster. This allows you to add these data sources in Grafana.\n\nPlease note that the required environment variables are defined in the `ray-cluster.embed-grafana.yaml` file. You can find more details about these variables in the \"Configuring and Managing Ray Dashboard\" documentation.\n\nTo embed Grafana panels in the Ray Dashboard, you can use the `kubectl port-forward` command to forward the Grafana service to a local port. For example, `kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/raycluster-embed-grafana-head-svc 8265:8265`. Then, you can visit `http://127.0.0.1:8265/#/metrics` in your browser to access the metrics.\n\nFinally, to view embedded time-series visualizations in the Ray Dashboard, ensure that the head node of the cluster can access Prometheus and Grafana, and the browser of the dashboard user can access Grafana. Use the `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` variable to set an address that the user's browsers can use to access Grafana and embed visualizations. If `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` is not set, Ray Dashboard will use the value of `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`.\n\nBy properly setting all the environment variables, you should be able to see time-series metrics in the Ray Dashboard."

For example, in the `ray.train.horovod.HorovodConfig` configuration, you can set the `timeout_s` parameter to a specific value (e.g., `300`) to define the timeout for the job.\n\nAdditionally, for long-running jobs, you may not want the client to wait for the job to finish. In this case, you can use the `--no-wait` flag when submitting the job using the `ray job submit` command. You can then use other CLI commands to check the status of the job.\n\nIt's worth noting that Ray Client is useful for developing interactively in a local Python shell, but it requires a stable connection to the remote cluster. If the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds, the workload will be terminated. For long-running workloads, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs instead.\n\nPlease refer to the specific Ray configuration or CLI commands for more details on how to add a timeout for your Ray job."

For example, RAY_TEMPDIR=\"/ray-mount\".\n\n2. Ensure that the directory specified by RAY_TEMPDIR is accessible by the host and the outer container.\n\nNote: It is recommended to build any necessary packages into a container image for production settings. You can push local files to the cluster using the \"ray rsync_up\" command.\n\nWhen connecting to a remote cluster, you may need to access the dashboard port of the cluster over HTTP. One way to do this is by port forwarding 127.0.0.1:8265 on your local machine to 127.0.0.1:8265 on the head node. If you started your remote cluster with the Ray Cluster Launcher, you can set up port forwarding automatically using the \"ray dashboard\" command.\n\nTo use the \"ray dashboard\" command, run the following command on your local machine, replacing \"cluster.yaml\" with the configuration file you used to launch your cluster:\n\n```\nray dashboard cluster.yaml\n```\n\nMake sure that your remote cluster has a similar environment to your local machine in terms of files, environment variables, and Python packages when transitioning from your local machine to the remote cluster."

Insufficient outbound bandwidth on the head node: The head node may experience high CPU usage if it does not have sufficient outbound bandwidth. It is recommended to ensure that the head node has adequate bandwidth, especially for large clusters.\n\n2. Task killed due to low memory on the node: If a node runs low on memory, tasks running on that node may be killed. This can result in spikes in CPU utilization as the system tries to handle the memory shortage.\n\n3. Scaling to accommodate requested resources: When requesting additional resources, such as CPUs, the cluster will attempt to scale immediately to meet the demand. This can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as new nodes are added to handle the increased workload.\n\n4. Specific task or service causing high CPU usage: The context mentions a specific service, \"NodeManagerService.grpc_server.PinObjectIDs,\" that has a total CPU time of 7.794 seconds. This indicates that this service may be causing spikes in CPU utilization.\n\nOverall, spikes in node CPU utilization can be caused by factors such as insufficient bandwidth, low memory, scaling to accommodate resource requests, or specific tasks/services consuming high CPU resources."

The timestamp follows the format \"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S_%f\" and the pid belongs to the startup process. The session directory is a subdirectory of the root temporary path, which is \"/tmp/ray/{ray_session_name}\" by default. You can change the root temporary directory by passing \"--temp-dir={your temp path}\" to the \"ray start\" command. However, there is currently no stable way to change the root temporary directory when calling \"ray.init()\". If you need to change it, you can provide the \"_temp_dir\" argument to \"ray.init()\"."

Instance failure: If the instance where the node was running fails, it can cause the node to crash.\n2. Raylet crash: If the raylet crashes unexpectedly due to reasons like out-of-memory (OOM) or preempted node, it can lead to the node crashing.\n\nIn the provided context, there are logs indicating that workers (tasks/actors) were killed due to memory pressure (OOM) on certain nodes. To get more information about the workers killed on those nodes, the command `ray logs raylet.out -ip <node_ip>` can be used.\n\nAdditionally, there is information about debugging routing issues and failures related to IP address mismatches. It is suggested to start the worker nodes more slowly to avoid overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections.\n\nThe context also mentions that when a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated as a node failure. Even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node in the Ray cluster.\n\nThere is also information about different exceptions that can occur, such as RayError, RayTaskError, RayActorError, TaskCancelledError, and TaskUnschedulableError.\n\nOverall, the causes for the node crashing unexpectedly can be related to instance failure, raylet crashes (such as OOM), and other issues like IP address mismatches or overloading the head node."

This could be due to the head node not running, a different version of Ray running at the specified address, the specified address being wrong, or firewall settings preventing access.\n\n2. There may be routing issues preventing the worker node from accessing the IP address. You can use the command \"ip route get xx.xx.xx.xx\" on the worker node to debug routing issues.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can use tools such as nmap or nc to check whether each port can be reached from the node.\n\nIt's important to note that the Global Control Service (GCS) is not fault-tolerant by default. If the GCS fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault-tolerant, HA Redis is required.\n\nBased on the provided context, it seems that the worker node is experiencing a health check failure, but the node itself is still running. You may need to further investigate the connectivity between the worker node and the head node, as well as any potential firewall settings or routing issues."

Increase the capacity of the object store: Objects are spilled to external storage when the capacity of the object store is used up. By increasing the capacity, you can reduce the likelihood of objects getting spilled. \n\n2. Use an SSD instead of an HDD: It is recommended to use an SSD (Solid State Drive) instead of an HDD (Hard Disk Drive) when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. SSDs have faster read and write speeds, which can improve the performance of object spilling.\n\n3. Specify a large buffer size: If you are using an HDD, it is recommended to specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. This can help optimize the performance of object spilling.\n\n4. Configure the directory for object spilling: By default, objects are spilled to Ray's temporary directory in the local filesystem. However, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using the appropriate settings in your code.\n\nPlease note that object spilling comes with a performance penalty since data needs to be written to disk. It is important to consider the trade-off between memory usage and performance when using object spilling for memory-intensive distributed applications."
