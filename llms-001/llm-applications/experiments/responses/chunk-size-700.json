            "answer": "When using Ray Data type conversions with `map_batches`, there are a few things you can keep in mind to avoid potential issues:\n\n1. Ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large. Large block sizes can lead to out-of-memory situations. To avoid this, make sure each item in your Ray Data is of a manageable size.\n\n2. Call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size that can comfortably fit into memory. This means choosing a batch size that is small enough to avoid memory issues.\n\n3. Configure the batch format using the `batch_format` parameter in `map_batches()`. By default, Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays. However, you can specify the batch format to be either NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames.\n\n4. To transform batches with tasks, you can call `map_batches()` with your transformation function. Ray Data uses tasks by default for batch transformations.\n\nHere's an example of using `map_batches()` with NumPy ndarrays as the batch format:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness, batch_format=\"numpy\")\n)\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of using `map_batches()` with tasks:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness)\n)\n```\n\nYou can also create a Ray Dataset from in-memory Python lists or other sources and file formats. For example:\n\n```python\ntrain_dataset = ray.data.from_items([{\"x\": [x], \"y\": [2 * x]} for x in range(200)])\n\ndef increment(batch):\n    batch[\"y\"] = batch[\"y\"] + 1\n    return batch\n\ntrain_dataset = train_dataset.map_batches(increment)\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the batch size and choose the appropriate batch format based on your specific requirements and available resources."

            "answer": "In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling automatically adjusts the number of replicas for a deployment based on its load. The autoscaling feature in Ray Serve increases or decreases the number of replicas to meet the resource demands of the workload. This is done by adjusting the number of worker nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups.\n\nThe Ray autoscaler, which is a process running on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod in Kubernetes, is responsible for managing the autoscaling. When the resource demands of the Ray workload exceed the current capacity of the cluster, the autoscaler tries to increase the number of worker nodes. Conversely, when worker nodes are idle, the autoscaler removes them from the cluster.\n\nIt's important to note that the autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, rather than application metrics or physical resource utilization. To configure autoscaling in a Ray application, you can refer to the user guides for Ray clusters on VMs or Kubernetes, depending on your deployment environment.\n\nHowever, it's recommended to start with non-autoscaling clusters if you're new to Ray, as autoscaling can add node launch overheads and may require careful configuration."

It provides big data collections that mimic the APIs of NumPy and Pandas, allowing operations on larger-than-memory data and running them on a multi-machine cluster. Dask also offers automatic data parallelism, smart scheduling, and optimized operations. It uses a task graph and scheduler to execute operations on these collections.\n\nRay, on the other hand, is a fast and fault-tolerant distributed task execution system. It provides a scheduler for Dask called \"dask_on_ray,\" which allows you to use Dask's collections and execute data analyses using the familiar NumPy and Pandas APIs on a Ray cluster. Dask abstractions should run seamlessly on top of Ray using this scheduler.\n\nSpark is another distributed data processing framework that is widely used in the industry. It is capable of handling batch processing workloads and provides a streaming paradigm suitable for GPU workloads in deep learning inference. Spark can also be used on top of Ray using a library called RayDP, which combines Spark and Ray clusters. This allows for large-scale data processing using the PySpark API and seamless integration with TensorFlow and PyTorch for model training.\n\nIn terms of performance, it is mentioned that Dask-on-Ray is an ongoing project and may not achieve the same performance as using Ray directly. However, Dask abstractions should work smoothly on top of Ray. A more detailed performance comparison between Ray Data, Apache Spark, and SageMaker can be found in the provided link.\n\nIn summary, Dask is focused on scaling analytics and scientific computing workloads, Ray is a fast and fault-tolerant distributed task execution system with a scheduler for Dask, and Spark is a widely used distributed data processing framework that can be used on top of Ray using RayDP."

This can cause issues like Out of Memory (OOM) errors. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each. The scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. However, tasks or actors that use more memory than their allocated share may overload a node. To prevent this, resources can be used to limit the number of concurrently running tasks or actors. For example, the memory resource can be used to limit the number of concurrently running tasks. It's important to note that resource requirements in Ray are logical, meaning that Ray will not enforce the physical resource usage of each task if it exceeds the specified amount.

            "answer": "The connection refused error you are experiencing when running `ray debug` on a remote Ray cluster could be due to a few reasons. \n\nFirstly, it is mentioned that the request to create Serve applications may fail initially because the necessary components such as the Dashboard, Dashboard Agent, and GCS take a few seconds to start up after the head Pod is ready. So, it is recommended to wait for at least 1 minute and try again.\n\nIf the issue persists, it is possible that the dashboard or dashboard agent may have failed to start. In this case, you can refer to the documentation provided for more details on starting and connecting to a remote cluster. The documentation also suggests defining an environment variable called RAY_ADDRESS in the same format as the address parameter to connect to an existing cluster with `ray.init()` or `ray.init(address=\"auto\")`.\n\nAdditionally, it is mentioned that you can manually start Ray by calling `ray.init()` with the necessary configuration options before creating a Pool. This can be useful if you are developing locally and want to connect to an existing cluster.\n\nIt is also worth noting that if you are using Ray Client, it requires a stable connection to the remote cluster and will terminate the workload if the connection is lost for more than 30 seconds. For long-running workloads, it is recommended to use Ray Jobs instead.\n\nTo test on a remote cluster, you can use `serve run` with the `--address` argument to specify the address of the Ray cluster to connect to. The address for remote clusters has the form `ray://<head-node-ip-address>:10001`.\n\nEnsure that your remote cluster has a similar environment to your local machine in terms of files, environment variables, and Python packages when transitioning from your local machine to the remote cluster."

This can include prompt preprocessing, vector database lookups, LLM API calls, and response validation.\n\n2. Define a deployment using the `@serve.deployment` decorator on a Python class or function. This deployment will contain the business logic or ML model to handle incoming requests.\n\n3. Bind the deployment with optional arguments to the constructor.\n\n4. Configure your deployment to scale out by increasing the number of deployment replicas and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs.\n\n5. Use the Ray Serve CLI to deploy your application to a Ray cluster. The `serve deploy` command takes in a config file path and deploys that file to a Ray cluster over HTTP. You can deploy to a local, single-node cluster or a remote, multi-node cluster started with the Ray Cluster Launcher.\n\n6. Update your application using the CLI if needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can rapidly prototype, develop, and deploy scalable LLM applications to production using Ray Serve."

However, it is mentioned that GPT-J is a relatively large model and may not fit on smaller GPU types with <=16 GB GRAM. To deal with this issue, the example suggests using DeepSpeed, a library that optimizes the training process and reduces GRAM usage. DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 is also mentioned as a way to load large models without running out of memory.\n\nTherefore, it is recommended to have a GPU with more than 16 GB GRAM and consider using DeepSpeed or DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 to handle the memory requirements of the \"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\" model."

Worker logs of Ray Jobs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while Driver logs are not. If the Ray Job was submitted via the Jobs API, you can find the captured Driver logs with the Dashboard UI, CLI (using the `ray job logs` command), or the Python SDK (`JobSubmissionClient.get_logs()` or `JobSubmissionClient.tail_job_logs()`).\n\n2. View the Driver logs: If you run Ray Jobs by executing the Ray Driver on the Head node directly or connecting via Ray Client, you can view the Driver logs in your terminal or Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n3. Use the `ray logs` command: You can use the `ray logs` command to get logs based on filename (cluster) or resource identifiers (actor). For example, you can use `ray logs cluster` to get all the log files available on a node. You can also specify the log file name and tail the last N lines using `ray logs cluster raylet.out --tail 500`. Additionally, you can use `ray logs actor` to follow the log file with a specific actor ID.\n\n4. Check the Logs view in the Dashboard: The Logs view in the Dashboard lists the Ray logs in your Cluster. It is organized by node and log file name. You can use the search functionality to find specific log messages. If the Ray Job was submitted via the Job API, the Job logs are available from the Dashboard, following the format: `job-driver-<job_submission_id>.log`.\n\n5. Check the output of the Ray job using kubectl: You can use the command `kubectl logs -l=job-name=rayjob-sample` to check the output of the Ray job.\n\n6. Check Task and Actor Logs: Task and Actor logs are accessible from the Task and Actor table view. Click the \"Log\" button to see the stdout and stderr logs that contain the output emitted from Tasks and Actors. For Actors, you can also see the system logs for the corresponding Worker process.\n\nNote: If you execute the Driver directly on the Head Node of the Ray Cluster without using the Job API or run with Ray Client, the Driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, you should refer to the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output to view the Driver logs."

Check the logs: The first step is to check the logs of the raylet on the specific node where the worker died. You can use the command `ray logs raylet.out -ip 172.31.183.172` to see more information about the workers killed on that node. This will provide you with additional details about the cause of the worker's termination.\n\n2. Look for memory pressure: From the provided context, it seems that the worker node was killed due to memory pressure (OOM - Out of Memory). This can happen when the worker exhausts its allocated memory. Check the memory usage of the worker nodes during training to see if they are reaching their memory limits. You can monitor the memory allocated and maximum memory allocated values in the logs, such as \"MemAllocated\" and \"MaxMemAllocated\".\n\n3. Adjust memory consumption: If memory pressure is the cause of the worker node dying, consider adjusting the memory consumption settings to reduce the memory usage. This can involve optimizing your Tensorflow code, reducing batch sizes, or using techniques like gradient checkpointing to reduce memory requirements.\n\n4. Check for cache flushes: The logs also mention \"pytorch allocator cache flushes\" happening frequently. This indicates high memory pressure and can negatively impact performance. Consider adjusting settings to reduce memory consumption, such as reducing the size of tensors or using techniques like gradient accumulation. Additionally, you can try adding `get_accelerator().empty_cache()` calls in your training loop to ensure that all ranks flush their caches at the same time.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the cause of the worker node dying and take appropriate actions to resolve the issue."

Overloading the head node can cause it to fail, resulting in the entire cluster failing. To tolerate head node failures, the GCS (Global Control Store) needs to be made fault tolerant so that cluster-level data is preserved when a new head node is started. When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated the same as a node failure. Even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster."

Import the `get_global_worker` function from `ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker`:\n   ```python\n   from ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker import get_global_worker\n   ```\n\n2. Use the `get_global_worker` function to retrieve the global rollout worker instance:\n   ```python\n   worker = get_global_worker()\n   ```\n\n3. Once you have the `worker` instance, you can access its methods and attributes to debug the deadlock issue. Some useful methods and attributes to investigate are:\n   - `worker.sample()` - This method is responsible for collecting samples from the environment.\n   - `worker.policy_map` - This attribute contains the policy models used by the algorithm.\n   - `worker.env` - This attribute holds the RL environment used for data collection.\n\nBy inspecting the code and using these methods and attributes, you can identify potential causes of the deadlock and debug the issue further."

The number of replicas can be scaled up or down to match the incoming request load.

This file allows you to define the desired configuration for your deployments.

The CLI will read the config file and create the specified deployments with the desired configuration.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ray Serve also provides options for running in production environments. If you are running on Kubernetes, you can use the KubeRay RayService custom resource, which handles important production requirements such as health checking, status reporting, failure recovery, and upgrades. If you are not using Kubernetes, you can still run Ray Serve on a Ray cluster directly using the Serve CLI. The production guide provides more details on these deployment options."

This means that actors can maintain their own state and mutate it as needed.\n\nHowever, there are also disadvantages to using singleton Actors. One disadvantage is that actors can fail if the actor process or the owner of the actor dies. The owner of an actor is the worker that originally created the actor. Detached actors, which do not have an owner process, are cleaned up when the Ray cluster is destroyed.\n\nAnother disadvantage is that if you don't need the stateful part of an actor, it is generally better to use tasks instead.

Define a function or a class that will be used as the user-defined function (UDF) for `map_batches`.\n2. If you are using a class-based UDF, specify the ActorPoolStrategy with the number of parallel actors using the `compute` argument.\n3. Use the `batch_size` argument to indicate the number of items in each batch.\n4. If needed, specify the number of GPUs needed for each instance using the `num_gpus` argument.\n5. Call the `map_batches` function on the dataset, passing the UDF and any additional arguments.\n6. The `map_batches` function will apply the UDF to the whole dataset in batches and return the results as a list of objects.\n\nHere is an example of using the `map_batches` function with a class-based UDF:\n\n```python\nclass MyUDF:\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        self.data = data\n\n    def process_batch(self, batch):\n        # Process the batch and return the result\n        ...\n\nds = ray.data.Dataset(...)\nudf = MyUDF(...)\nbatch_size = 32\nnum_gpus = 1\n\nresults = ds.map_batches(udf.process_batch, compute=ray.actor.ActorPoolStrategy, batch_size=batch_size, num_gpus=num_gpus)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `process_batch` method of the `MyUDF` class will be called for each batch of data in the dataset. The results will be returned as a list of objects in the `results` variable."

For example, if you want to run each evaluation step for exactly 10 episodes, you can use the following configuration:\n\n```\n{\n    \"evaluation_duration\": 10,\n    \"evaluation_duration_unit\": \"episodes\"\n}\n```\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to set the maximum episode length in terms of timesteps, you can set \"evaluation_duration\" to the desired number of timesteps and \"evaluation_duration_unit\" to \"timesteps\". For example, if you want to run each evaluation step for (close to) 200 timesteps, you can use the following configuration:\n\n```\n{\n    \"evaluation_duration\": 200,\n    \"evaluation_duration_unit\": \"timesteps\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that when using \"evaluation_duration_unit\" as \"timesteps\" and the specified number of timesteps is not divisible by the number of evaluation workers, RLlib will round up the number of timesteps specified.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to disable smoothing and always report only the most recently collected episode's return, you can set \"evaluation_interval\" to 1.\n\n```\n{\n    \"evaluation_interval\": 1\n}\n```\n\nI hope this helps!"

When data is put into the object store, it remains local to the node where it was written until requested by another task or actor on another node. The object store memory is used when objects are created in the object store using the `ray.put` function and when values are returned from remote functions. Objects in the object store are reference counted and evicted when they fall out of scope. The object store memory is allocated to `/dev/shm` for Linux and `/tmp` for MacOS. In Ray 1.3+, objects are spilled to disk if the object store fills up. Object store shared memory is used when objects are read via `ray.get`. If an object is already present on the node, additional allocations are not required, allowing large objects to be efficiently shared among many actors and tasks. Object spilling is the process of spilling objects to external storage once the capacity of the object store is used up, enabling out-of-core data processing for memory-intensive distributed applications. However, this comes with a performance penalty since data needs to be written to disk."

For example:\n\n```bash\n$ ray job submit --working-dir your_working_directory -- python script.py\n```\n\nNote: If you are using a remote cluster, replace \"127.0.0.1\" in the command with the head node's IP address.\n\n5. Optionally, you can pass headers per HTTP request to the cluster using the `RAY_JOB_HEADERS` environment variable. The headers should be in JSON form. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ export RAY_JOB_HEADERS='{\"KEY\": \"VALUE\"}'\n```\n\n6. The job will be submitted, and the Ray job server will generate a new job ID and return it. You can also choose a unique job ID string and pass it into `submit_job()` if desired.\n\n7. You can check the status of the job using the `JobSubmissionClient` object. For example:\n\n```python\nclient = JobSubmissionClient(\"http://127.0.0.1:8265\")\njob_id = client.submit_job(\n    entrypoint=\"python script.py\",  # Entrypoint shell command to execute\n    runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"./\"}  # Path to the local directory that contains the script.py file\n)\nprint(job_id)\n```\n\nThese steps should allow you to submit a job with Python using local files."

Set up the necessary configurations in the `__init__` method and define the data transformation logic in the `__call__` method.\n\n2. Create an `ActorPoolStrategy` object and configure the number of concurrent workers. Each worker will be responsible for transforming a partition of the data.\n\n3. Call the `map_batches()` function and pass your `ActorPoolStrategy` object to the `compute` parameter. This will distribute the data transformation task among the actors.\n\nHere is an example code snippet that demonstrates the usage of actors for batch transformation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nimport ray\n\nclass TorchPredictor:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.model = torch.nn.Identity()\n        self.model.eval()\n\n# Create an ActorPoolStrategy with the desired number of workers\nstrategy = ActorPoolStrategy(min_size=2, max_size=8)\n\n# Call map_batches() and pass the ActorPoolStrategy to compute\nresult = dask_client.map_batches(TorchPredictor, batch_size=256, compute=strategy).take()\n```\n\nThis code snippet shows how to use actors for batch transformation using the Ray API. The `TorchPredictor` class represents the actor, and the `map_batches()` function distributes the data transformation task among the actors. The `batch_size` parameter specifies the size of each batch.\n\nNote that this example assumes you have already set up the necessary dependencies and initialized the Ray runtime."

Be cautious when running tests in parallel, as mentioned in Tip 4. Parallel execution of tests can introduce concurrency issues in Ray programs.\n\nAdditionally, you can refer to the Ray Integration section for Java code examples that demonstrate how to use Ray in your tests.\n\nRemember to import the necessary Ray modules and classes, such as `io.ray.api.ObjectRef`, `io.ray.api.PyActorHandle`, `io.ray.api.Ray`, `io.ray.api.function.PyActorClass`, `io.ray.api.function.PyActorMethod`, `io.ray.api.function.PyFunction`, and `org.testng.Assert`, as shown in the provided Java code snippet.\n\nFor more detailed tutorials and examples, you can explore the Ray Tutorials and Examples section."

            "answer": "To kill a detached actor in Ray, you can use the `ray.kill` function. This function forcefully terminates the actor, interrupting any running tasks and causing them to fail immediately. It does not run any atexit handlers installed in the actor.\n\nIf you want to let pending tasks finish before killing the actor, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead. This queues a termination task and allows atexit handlers to run before the actor is terminated.\n\nIn C++, customizing the lifetime of an actor has not been implemented yet. Detached actors in C++ are not automatically garbage-collected by Ray and must be manually destroyed using `ray.kill`.\n\nIn Python, you can manually terminate an actor using `ray.kill(actor_handle)`. This should be reserved for cases where the actor is unexpectedly hanging or leaking resources, or for detached actors that need to be manually destroyed. Note that calling `ray.kill` does not go through the normal Python sys.exit teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `atexit` will not be called.\n\nIf you want to kill actors immediately, you can also call `ray.kill(actor)`. A remote actor will be terminated when all actor handles to it in Python are deleted. If you only have one reference to an actor handle, calling `del actor` could trigger actor deletion. However, actor termination will not occur until the reference count goes to 0.\n\nIn case of a misbehaving actor, you can recover from the failure by manually terminating the actor using `ray.kill` on any handle to the actor. It does not need to be the original handle. If `max_restarts` is set, you can allow Ray to automatically restart the actor by passing `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill`."

Within the actor, you can define methods that can be invoked concurrently in the event loop. For example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# Invoke the actor's method in parallel using ray.get\nray.get([actor.run_concurrent.remote() for _ in range(4)])\n```\n\nIn addition, you can also use `asyncio.run` to asynchronously invoke Ray methods.

You can wait for the actor to exit by calling `ObjectRef::get()`, which will throw a `RayActorException`.\n\nIn C++, you can use `ray::ExitActor()` to terminate an actor.

You can check if the actor is dead by using the command `ray list actors --detail`.\n\nTo immediately exit an actor's process in C++, you can use `actor_handle.Kill()`.

To access paths relative to the original working directory, you can use the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR=0` environment variable. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes. If you are running on multiple machines, you must ensure that the directory is synced on all nodes.\n\nThe `TUNE_ORIG_WORKING_DIR` environment variable was the original workaround for accessing paths relative to the original working directory, but it is now deprecated. It is recommended to use the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR` environment variable instead.\n\nAdditionally, when specifying the `working_dir` and `py_modules` arguments in the `runtime_env` dictionary for remote URIs, you can specify either local paths or remote URIs. A local path should be a directory path, and the directory's contents will be directly accessed as the working directory or a `py_module`. A remote URI should be a link directly to a zip file containing only a single top-level directory. The contents of this directory will be directly accessed as the working directory or a `py_module`.\n\nIt is important to note that when using excludes, you should not use absolute paths. Instead, use relative paths to match specific directories.\n\nLastly, for Ray actors, the current working directory of both functional and class trainables is set to the corresponding trial directory once it has been launched as a remote Ray actor."

            "answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that you are experiencing issues with displaying the Ray Dashboard when tunneling the dashboard port from the headnode to your machine. The dashboard opens initially but then disappears due to an internal refresh failure.\n\nThis issue could be caused by a few factors. Firstly, it is important to note that when starting a remote Ray cluster, the dashboard port may not be publicly exposed by default. Therefore, you need to set up additional configurations to access the Ray Dashboard from outside the head node.\n\nTo troubleshoot the problem, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Ensure that you have proper authentication in place before exposing the Ray Dashboard publicly for security purposes.\n\n2. If you are using the VM Cluster Launcher, you can set up port forwarding to access the dashboard. The specific instructions for port forwarding may vary depending on your setup.\n\n3. Check if the Ray Dashboard port is customized. By default, the Ray Dashboard runs on port 8265 of the head node. If you have customized the port, make sure you are using the correct port number when tunneling.\n\n4. If you are running a single-node local cluster, you can start the cluster explicitly with the CLI and pass the `--dashboard-port` argument with the `ray start` command. Alternatively, you can start the cluster implicitly with `ray.init` and pass the `dashboard_port` keyword argument.\n\n5. Verify that the Ray Dashboard agent's default port (52365) is available. If you have set a different port using the `--dashboard-agent-listen-port` argument, ensure that it is also available. If the specified port is unavailable when Ray starts, the dashboard agent's HTTP server will fail.\n\n6. Check if the import path is accessible when running on a remote cluster. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are properly configured to avoid any issues.\n\nIf the problem persists after trying these steps, it may be helpful to consult the official Ray documentation or seek assistance from the Ray community for further troubleshooting."

It runs on the Ray head node and is responsible for managing node membership, actor directory, and other cluster-level operations such as actor and placement group management.\n\nIf your GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node, it could be due to the fact that the head node has more memory-demanding system components like GCS or the dashboard. Additionally, if you are running the same number of tasks and actors from the head node as you would from worker nodes, it can easily lead to out-of-memory problems. In such cases, it is recommended not to run any tasks and actors on the head node by specifying \"--num-cpus=0\" when starting the head node.\n\nRegarding the error message about too many open files, it is common for the head node GCS process to have a large number of connections because it is a centralized component that many other components in Ray communicate with. To address this, you can adjust the maximum file descriptors limit per process using the \"ulimit\" command. It is recommended to set it to \"ulimit -n 65536\" in the host configuration. This limit can handle around 10000-15000 workers and 1000-2000 nodes.\n\nIn terms of fault tolerance, by default, the GCS is not fault tolerant as all the data is stored in-memory. If the GCS fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required. When the GCS restarts, it loads all the data from the Redis instance and resumes regular functions. However, during the recovery period, certain functions like actor creation, deletion, and reconstruction, placement group creation, deletion, and reconstruction, and resource management may not be available.\n\nIt is also important to note that because all nodes and workers connect to the GCS, the operating system needs to support the large number of network connections that are created."

Ensure that the Kubernetes cluster has enough resources, such as CPU and memory, to handle the workload.\n\n2. Reproduce the issue: You can perform an experiment to reproduce the situation by setting up a Kubernetes cluster with an 8-CPUs node and using the provided `ray-service.insufficient-resources.yaml` file.\n\n3. Restart the Ray cluster: If your program freezes or encounters issues, you can try restarting the Ray cluster without running any installation commands using the following command: `$ ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n\n4. Check for errors: If the pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can use the `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` command to check for errors. Make sure to verify that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.\n\n5. Wait for pods to reach Running state: It may take a few minutes for the pods to reach the Running state, as most of the time is spent downloading the Ray images. Be patient and allow enough time for the pods to start.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and debug the issue with the pending nodes in your Ray cluster."

The Kuberay operator logs contain information about the Serve application deployment event and Serve application health checks.\n\n2. Check the controller log and deployment log, which are located under `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/` in both the head node pod and worker node pod. These logs contain information about specific deployment failure reasons and autoscaling events.\n\n3. Find a copy of these logs at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`. You can parse these stored logs with a logging stack such as ELK or Loki to be able to search by deployment or replica. Serve supports log rotation of these logs through setting the environment variables `RAY_ROTATION_MAX_BYTES` and `RAY_ROTATION_BACKUP_COUNT`.\n\n4. Use the Ray dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application's states. The dashboard provides details such as the number of deployment replicas currently running, logs for your Serve controller, deployment replicas, and proxies, and the Ray nodes running in your Ray cluster.

            "answer": "To kill a \"detached\" actor in Ray, you can use the `ray.kill` function. Detached actors are not automatically garbage-collected by Ray, so they must be manually destroyed once they are no longer needed. The `ray.kill` function forcefully terminates the actor and interrupts any running tasks on it, causing them to fail immediately. It does not run any atexit handlers installed in the actor.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.kill` to kill a detached actor:\n\n```python\nray.kill(actor)\n```\n\nAfter calling `ray.kill`, the actor's name may be reused. Subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail.\n\nIt's important to note that for non-detached actors, the owner of the actor is the worker that created it. If the owner of an actor dies, the actor will also be terminated. However, detached actors do not have an owner process and will continue to be automatically restarted by Ray until the maximum restarts is exceeded, the actor is destroyed, or the Ray cluster is destroyed.\n\nPlease refer to the provided code snippets for more information and examples."

When you call `ray.get` on a canceled task, it will raise a `TaskCancelledError` if the task has been scheduled or interrupted.\n\nTo cancel a task in Ray, you can use the `ray.cancel()` function on the returned object reference. For example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\n\nIn Ray, the cancellation behavior depends on the task's current state. For unscheduled tasks, Ray attempts to cancel the scheduling. If the actor task hasn't been scheduled yet and is successfully canceled at this stage, invoking `ray.get(actor_task_ref)` will produce a `TaskCancelledError`.\n\nFor running actor tasks (regular actor, threaded actor), Ray does not offer a mechanism for interruption.\n\nFor running async actor tasks, Ray seeks to cancel the associated `asyncio.Task`."

This is used for health checks on Grafana on the backend. For example, if the IP of the head node is 55.66.77.88 and Grafana is hosted on port 3000, you would set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST=http://55.66.77.88:3000`.\n\n2. `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST`: Set this variable to an address that the head node can use to access Prometheus. This is used to retrieve metrics data. The specific address will depend on your Prometheus setup.\n\nTo set these variables more intelligently, given that the head node IP is changing every time the cluster is reconfigured, you can use environment variables or dynamic DNS services. For example, you can use a service like AWS Route 53 to dynamically update the DNS record for the head node's IP address.\n\nAdditionally, you can set the `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` variable to an address that the user's browsers can use to access Grafana and embed visualizations. If this variable is not set, Ray Dashboard will use the value of `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`.\n\nMake sure to configure these settings using the environment variables mentioned above when starting the Ray Clusters.\n\nNote: If you use a different Prometheus server for each Ray Cluster and use the same Grafana server for all clusters, you can set the `RAY_PROMETHEUS_NAME` environment variable to different values for each Ray Cluster and add these datasources in Grafana.\n\nPlease refer to the provided context for more details and examples of the environment variable configurations."

Each raylet is associated with a unique ID, so even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n\n2. Worker node failure: When a worker node fails, the actors running on it also fail. Serve detects that the actors have failed and attempts to respawn them on the remaining healthy nodes. Meanwhile, KubeRay detects that the node itself has failed and attempts to restart the worker pod on another running node. It also brings up a new healthy node to replace the failed one. Once the node comes up, if the pod is still pending, it can be restarted on that node. Similarly, Serve can also respawn any pending actors on that node. The deployment replicas running on healthy nodes can continue serving traffic throughout the recovery period.\n\nIn the provided context, there is also an example of an actor that has changed its status to dead due to the worker process dying.

Raylet crash: The raylet, which is responsible for managing workers and tasks, may have crashed unexpectedly. This can occur due to reasons such as out-of-memory (OOM) errors or preempted nodes.\n\nThe provided context also mentions that one worker was killed due to memory pressure (OOM) on the node with the ID 2c82620270df6b9dd7ae2791ef51ee4b5a9d5df9f795986c10dd219c and IP 172.31.183.172. To get more information about the workers killed on this node, you can use the command `ray logs raylet.out -ip 172.31.183.172`.\n\nOther possible exceptions related to node failure or system errors include:\n- LocalRayletDiedError: Indicates that the task's local raylet died.\n- WorkerCrashedError: Indicates that the worker died unexpectedly while executing a task.\n- TaskPlacementGroupRemoved: Raised when the corresponding placement group was removed.\n- ActorPlacementGroupRemoved: Raised when the corresponding placement group was removed.\n- ObjectStoreFullError: Indicates that the object store is full.\n- OutOfDiskError: Indicates that the local disk is full.\n- ObjectLostError: Indicates that the object is lost from distributed memory due to node failure or system error.\n\nThe context also suggests possible solutions to address the out-of-memory issue, such as provisioning more memory on the node or reducing task parallelism by requesting more CPUs per task. It provides documentation on how to handle the out-of-memory issue and adjust the kill threshold. Additionally, it mentions that when a raylet process fails, the corresponding node will be marked as dead and treated the same as a node failure. Even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster."

Check the log directory `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/` in the head Pod for any errors related to the GCS server. This can help identify any issues with the GCS server process in the head Pod.\n\n2. Ensure that the `ray` executable is included in the `$PATH` for the image. If it is not included, the init container will fail to run the ray health-check.\n\n3. Verify that the `CLUSTER_DOMAIN` environment variable is set correctly. This variable is used for cluster domain configuration and may cause issues if not set correctly.\n\n4. Check if there are any firewall settings preventing access between the worker node and the head node. The error message suggests using tools like `nmap` or `nc` to check if each port can be reached from the worker node to the head node.\n\n5. Verify that the head node is running and accessible at the specified address. Ensure that the specified address is correct and that there are no other versions of Ray running at that address.\n\nBy following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the GCS health check failure for the node."

This method does not require executing commands in the Ray head pod. Instead, you can use the Ray job submission SDK to submit Ray jobs to the RayCluster via the Ray Dashboard port (8265 by default). The KubeRay operator configures a Kubernetes service targeting the Ray head Pod.\n\nTo check the status of the RayJob, you can use the following command:\n```\nkubectl get rayjobs.ray.io rayjob-sample -o json | jq '.status.jobStatus'\n```\n\nThe output will show the status of the RayJob, which should be \"SUCCEEDED\" once the job finishes.\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that the RayCluster is created based on the rayClusterSpec custom resource, and a Kubernetes Job is created to submit the Ray job to the RayCluster. The entrypoint field of the RayJob custom resource defines the Ray job, and in the example provided, the entrypoint is `python /home/ray/samples/sample_code.py`.

            "answer": "To avoid objects from getting spilled in Ray, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. Use high-performance storage: If possible, use NVMe SSDs or other high-performance storage devices. This can help prevent object spilling and avoid performance problems.\n\n2. Configure object spilling directory: By default, Ray spills objects to its temporary directory in the local filesystem. However, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using the `_system_config` parameter in the `ray.init()` function. You can specify the directory path using the `directory_path` parameter. For example:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport ray\n\nray.init(\n    _system_config={\n        \"object_spilling_config\": json.dumps(\n            {\"type\": \"filesystem\", \"params\": {\"directory_path\": \"/tmp/spill\"}},\n        )\n    },\n)\n```\n\n3. Spread IO load and disk space usage: If needed, you can specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices. This can be useful, especially if you have SSD devices. You can specify multiple directories by providing a list of directory paths in the `directory_path` parameter.\n\nIt's important to note that object spilling comes with a performance penalty since data needs to be written to disk. However, it enables out-of-core data processing for memory-intensive distributed applications."

Eventually, the killed replica will restart and continue serving requests.\n\nYou can also use the Ray State API to check the status of the controller:\n\n```bash\n$ ray list actors --filter \"class_name=ServeController\"\n```\n\nTo kill the Serve controller, you can get a handle to it using its name from the `ray list actor` output. Then, call `ray.kill()` with the controller handle and set `no_restart=True`.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\ncontroller_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_CONTROLLER_ACTOR\", namespace=\"serve\")\nray.kill(controller_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\n\nSimulating a Serve controller failure can be done by manually killing the Serve actor. If you are running KubeRay, you can execute the following command to get a list of pods:\n\n```bash\n$ kubectl get pods\n```\n\nOnce you have the pod name, you can exec into one of the pods using the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/bash\n```\n\nFrom there, you can manually kill the Serve actor to simulate a controller failure."
