This feature allows the application to efficiently accommodate user traffic without wasting resources. The autoscaler, which is a process that runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes, monitors the resource demands of the Ray workload. When the demands exceed a certain threshold, the autoscaler scales the cluster up by adding more replicas. Conversely, when the demands decrease, the autoscaler scales the cluster down by removing replicas. To configure the autoscaler, you can use the Ray cluster launcher and adjust the settings based on the resource demand of your application."

If you are running Ray on a remote multi-user cluster without sudo access, you may need to run the following commands to ensure TensorBoard can write to the tmp directory:\n   ```\n   tensorboard --logdir [directory]\n   ```\n\n5. If you are running multiple experiments, make sure to vary the directory to which TensorFlow saves its progress. This can be found in the code file (e.g., a3c.py).\n\nOverall, Ray supports multiple storage options for experiment results (such as NFS and cloud storage) and can log results to tools like MLflow and TensorBoard.

The log entry states that 10 workers were killed due to memory pressure, and 0 workers crashed due to other reasons. \n\nTo debug this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the memory usage of your worker nodes: Monitor the memory usage of your worker nodes to see if they are running out of memory. You can use system monitoring tools or Ray's built-in monitoring features to track memory usage.\n\n2. Increase the memory allocation for your worker nodes: If you find that the worker nodes are consistently running out of memory, you may need to allocate more memory to them. This can be done by adjusting the configuration settings for your worker nodes.\n\n3. Optimize your TensorFlow code: Review your TensorFlow code to ensure that it is optimized for memory usage. Look for any memory leaks or inefficient memory usage patterns that could be causing the OOM errors.\n\n4. Reduce the number of workers: If increasing the memory allocation is not feasible, you may need to reduce the number of workers to alleviate the memory pressure. This can be done by decreasing the number of workers in your TensorFlowTrainer configuration.\n\n5. Check for any other error messages or logs: Look for any other error messages or logs that could provide more information about the cause of the worker node deaths. Check for any specific error messages related to TensorFlow or Ray that could help pinpoint the issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug the issue and address the worker node deaths caused by memory pressure."

Metrics overload: If the head node in the cluster is overwhelmed with metrics, it may cause the dashboard or other control processes to stall, leading to the cluster becoming unusable.\n\n2. Node failures: Nodes in the cluster may fail, which can have an impact on tasks, actors, and objects within the cluster.\n\n3. Single point of failure: In some cases, the head node in the cluster may be a single point of failure. If it crashes, the entire cluster crashes and needs to be restarted. This can introduce downtime, although in a Kubernetes environment, the RayService controller health-checks the cluster and restarts it if a head node failure occurs.\n\n4. Simulating head node failure: It is possible to simulate a head node failure by killing the head pod or the head node. However, it is generally quicker to simulate failures by killing at the pod level rather than at the node level, as waiting for a node to recover usually takes longer.\n\nOverall, nodes in a cluster can die due to various reasons such as metrics overload, node failures, and single point of failure in the head node."

A block is an internal abstraction and is not directly accessed by the user.\n\nOn the other hand, a batch is a user-facing object. It is used in batch training with Ray Data. When using the `map_batches()` function in Ray Data, the user can specify a batch size. This function loads and transforms blocks in parallel, and the output batch is a subset of rows from the dataset.\n\nIt is important to note that using a large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, it is recommended to ensure that no single item in the Ray Data is too large and to use a small enough batch size in `map_batches()` so that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory."

However, keep in mind that modifying the code is necessary whenever one of the parameters needs to change.\n\nTo view the Serve configuration, you can use the command \"serve build\" which will print the Serve configuration. You can then copy and paste this configuration directly into your Kubernetes config and RayService CR.\n\nFor in-place updates of Ray Serve applications, you can update the Ray Serve config in the RayService CR config and use \"kubectl apply\" to update the applications.

Retrieval from any job in the Ray cluster: By giving an actor a unique name within its namespace, you can retrieve the actor from any job in the Ray cluster. This is useful when you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it or when you are trying to access the actor from different parts of the cluster.\n\n2. Flexibility in handling actor handles: Naming an actor allows you to pass around the actor handle without worrying about losing access to the actor. This can be particularly useful when you need to retrieve the actor at a later point in your code.\n\n3. Improved fault tolerance: Named actors can be retrieved as long as the original driver is still running. This means that even if a driver fails or is restarted, you can still access the named actor as long as the driver is active.\n\nOverall, using named actors provides flexibility, ease of access, and improved fault tolerance in distributed computing scenarios.

However, you need to be careful when using this setting because if your environment does not terminate easily, it could lead to enormous batch sizes.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `Policy.postprocess_trajectory()` function to further process the trajectory data.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the provided context does not explicitly mention how to set the maximum episode length, but it provides information on the `batch_mode` and `rollout_fragment_length` settings that can be used to achieve this."

Make sure that the batch size you have configured is within the recommended limits.\n\n2. Move the data loader to the training function: The warning message also mentions that the actor TrainTrainable is very large (52 MiB) and suggests checking its definition. It advises using ray.put() to put large objects in the Ray object store. Consider moving the data loader to the training function and using ray.put() to handle large objects.\n\n3. Check the model size: The context includes code snippets related to loading and using a model. Ensure that the model size is not excessively large, as it could contribute to the actor being too large. If the model is large, consider optimizing or reducing its size.\n\n4. Verify actor configuration: Double-check the configuration of the actor pool and the actors themselves. Ensure that the number of actors and their placement are appropriate for your use case.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ValueError related to the actor being too large."

One specific example mentioned is the inability to pickle SSLContext objects.\n\nRay has implemented a customized Pickle protocol version 5 backport to replace the original PyArrow serializer. This custom implementation overcomes limitations such as the inability to serialize recursive objects. Ray is also compatible with Pickle protocol version 5, which allows serialization of a wider range of objects, including lambda and nested functions, as well as dynamic classes.\n\nIt is worth noting that Ray's default pickle protocol is version 5, while the default pickle protocol used by most Python distributions is protocol 3.

Pass the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed. Note that using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported.\n\nHere is an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self, init_value):\n        self.i = init_value\n\n    def inc(self, x):\n        self.i += x\n\n    def get(self):\n        return self.i\n\nprint(\"Starting actor.\")\nmy_actor = Actor.remote(\"my_actor\")\nprint(\"Calling actor.\")\nmy_actor.inc.remote(-10)\nprint(\"Calling actor.\")\nmy_actor.inc.remote(5)\nprint(\"Metrics should be exported.\")\nprint(\"See http://localhost:8080 (this may take a few seconds to load).\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Actor` class is defined as a remote actor using the `@ray.remote` decorator. The `__init__` method initializes the actor's instance variable `self.i` with the `init_value` parameter. The `inc` method increments the value of `self.i` by the given `x` parameter. The `get` method returns the current value of `self.i`.\n\nTo modify or access the state of the actor, you can call the actor's methods using the actor handle (`my_actor`).

Start a new Ray cluster for each test: It is recommended to start a new Ray cluster for each test to ensure isolation. You can achieve this by importing the `unittest` module and creating a test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. In the `setUp` method of the test class, initialize Ray with the desired resource configuration. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n```\n\n6. Follow testing tips for Ray programs: Ray programs can be challenging to test due to their parallel nature. Here are some tips and tricks for testing Ray programs:\n\n- Tip 1: Fix the resource quantity with `ray.init(num_cpus=...)` to ensure consistent testing conditions.\n- Tip 2: If possible, start a new Ray cluster for each test to avoid interference between tests.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you can effectively write unit tests for your Ray code."

This asynchronous nature of Ray is key to achieving parallelism. Ray natively integrates with asyncio, allowing you to use Ray alongside popular async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. Ray enables arbitrary functions to be executed asynchronously on separate Python workers, which are called \"tasks\". These tasks can specify their resource requirements in terms of CPUs, GPUs, and custom resources. However, it is important to note that this feature is experimental and the API's semantics may change. Additionally, Ray's async functionality does not currently support Ray Client."

If so, the loop will not continue until the call to `ray.get()` is resolved.\n3. Use the debugger command `get` to jump to the location where `ray.get()` is called on the result. You can use `get` again to jump back to the original call site and use `p(result)` to print the result.\n4. It is recommended to wait as long as possible before calling `ray.get()`, or even design your program to avoid calling it altogether.\n5. Separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. This allows all remote functions to be spawned before waiting for the results, enabling them to run in parallel in the background.\n6. Instead of calling `ray.get()` with a single object reference, you can pass a list of object references to it.\n\nNote that the provided code snippet is an anti-pattern and will hang because it doesn't instantiate the receive side call."

These guides provide instructions on how to set up and interact with Ray clusters on Kubernetes.\n\nAdditionally, you can refer to the documentation and quickstart guides for more detailed information on deploying Ray on Kubernetes. It is important to configure pools of Kubernetes nodes to successfully deploy Ray on Kubernetes, and you can find guidance on how to do this in the documentation.\n\nTo begin, you need to identify the Ray head node. The static Ray cluster configuration file sets up a Kubernetes service that targets the Ray head pod. This service allows you to interact with Ray clusters without directly executing commands in the Ray container."

This decorator allows the class to be executed remotely as an Actor. For example:\n   ```python\n   @ray.remote\n   class MyActor:\n       def __init__(self):\n           # Initialize the Actor's state here\n           pass\n\n       def my_method(self):\n           # Define the methods of the Actor here\n           pass\n   ```\n\n3.

For example:\n   ```python\n   actor = MyActor.remote()\n   actor.my_method.remote()\n   ```\n\n4. When deploying your code, make sure to pass the runtime environment using the `ray_actor_options` parameter. This can be done by running the following command before deployment:\n   ```bash\n   pip install \"ray[default]\"\n   ```\n\n   This ensures that the Runtime Environments feature is installed.\n\nNote: The provided context does not explicitly mention how to push a custom module to Ray.

When you start a remote Ray cluster on Amazon using the VM Cluster Launcher, KubeRay operator, or manual configuration, the Ray Dashboard launches on the head node but the dashboard port may not be publicly exposed. \n\nTo access the Ray Dashboard from outside the head node, you need to perform additional setup. You can refer to the documentation on configuring the dashboard for instructions on how to view the Dashboard from outside the head node.\n\nIf you want to change the Ray Dashboard port, by default it runs on port 8265 of the head node. You can customize the port by following the instructions provided in the documentation.\n\nThe Ray Dashboard provides a visual interface that displays real-time system metrics, node-level resource monitoring, job profiling, and task visualizations. It is designed to help users understand the performance of their Ray applications and identify potential issues."

Wait for the pending cluster to become healthy and transition to the active state. Once the pending cluster is healthy, the previous cluster will be terminated.\n\n3. Make sure that you have started the Ray cluster correctly using the command `ray start --head --port=6379`. This command will print out the Ray cluster address, which you can pass to `ray start` on other machines to start the worker nodes.\n\n4. If you encounter a ConnectionError, check your firewall settings and network configuration to ensure that the necessary ports are open for communication.\n\n5. If the Ray cluster is already started, you don't need to run anything on the worker nodes separately.\n\n6. If your program freezes, you can restart the Ray cluster without running any installation commands using the command `ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n\n7. If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can use `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` to check for errors. Additionally, ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough to avoid any resource constraints.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug the issue of pending nodes when starting a Ray cluster."

You can catch this exception and handle it accordingly in your code.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the RaySystemError exception:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.exceptions import RaySystemError\n\ntry:\n    # Your code that may raise an uncaught exception\n    ...\nexcept RaySystemError as e:\n    # Handle the exception\n    ...\n```\n\nAdditionally, make sure you have a running Ray Serve controller and that you are calling the code from within a Serve application. If you are calling from outside a Serve application, you need to specify the application name. Otherwise, a RayServeException will be raised.\n\nPlease note that the Ray Serve API may change across minor Ray releases, so it's important to refer to the documentation for the specific version of Ray you are using.\n\nFor debugging purposes, you can set the RAY_BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL environment variable to \"debug\" before starting Ray. This will print any debug log lines in the source code to the raylet.err file, which can be found in the Logging and Debugging section of the Ray documentation."

Ray Serve uses Python's standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". The logs are streamed to the driver Ray program, which is the Python script that calls `serve.run()` or the `serve run` CLI command. Therefore, to view the logs, you need to keep the driver running while debugging.\n\nIf you execute the driver directly on the head node of the Ray cluster or run with Ray Client, the driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, you can view the driver logs in your terminal or Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nPlease note that the APIs for accessing logs from Ray clusters are still in alpha and require a full installation of Ray using `pip install \"ray[default]\"`."

This means that while the tuner is in the \"running\" state, it is not actively using the CPU resources. Additionally, when using Ray Data in conjunction with Ray Tune, it is important to ensure that there are enough free CPUs for Ray Data to run on. By default, Tune tries to fully utilize cluster CPUs, which can prevent Ray Data from scheduling tasks and reduce performance or cause workloads to hang."

Determine the IP address of the head node dynamically.\n2. Use this IP address to construct the values for `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` and `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` variables.\n\nFor example, if the IP address of the head node is 55.66.77.88 and Grafana is hosted on port 3000, you would set the value of `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` as `http://55.66.77.88:3000`.\n\nRemember to configure these settings using the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`, `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST`, `RAY_PROMETHEUS_NAME`, and `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` environment variables when starting the Ray Clusters.\n\nIf all the environment variables are set properly, you should be able to see time-series metrics in the Ray Dashboard."

This can be resolved by starting the worker nodes more slowly. Additionally, if application tasks or actors consume a large amount of heap space, it can cause the node to run out of memory (OOM). When this happens, the operating system may start killing worker or raylet processes, which can disrupt the application. OOM may also stall metrics and, if it occurs on the head node, it may stall the dashboard or other control processes and render the cluster unusable."

Check that the Ray GCS (Global Control Service) with the matching version is running successfully at the specified address. Ensure that the GCS is started and functioning properly.\n\n2. Verify that the worker node can connect to the head node. Make sure there are no network connectivity issues between the worker and head nodes. You can check for any firewall rules or network configurations that might be blocking the connection.\n\n3. If you are using a custom worker init container, ensure that it is properly configured and working for your specific use case. The default worker init container may not work for all scenarios, so customizing it might be necessary.\n\n4. Keep in mind that while the head node is recovering, Serve applications can still handle traffic via worker nodes, but they may not be able to update or recover from other failures such as actors or worker nodes crashing. Once the GCS is recovered, the cluster should return to normal behavior.\n\nIf the issue persists, you can try checking the logs of the GCS server using the command \"ray logs gcs_server.out --node-id <NODE_ID>\". This might provide more detailed information about the health check failure and help in troubleshooting the problem further."
