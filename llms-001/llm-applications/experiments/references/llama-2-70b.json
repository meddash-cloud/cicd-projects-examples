Additionally, if the number of physical cores is fewer than the number of logical cores, it can also result in low CPU usage. Furthermore, small tasks can also lead to low CPU usage as Ray introduces some overhead for each task. Lastly, variable durations can also result in low CPU usage as the slowest task will be waited for. To avoid these issues, batching tasks together, using ray.wait, setting environment variables such as MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1, and avoiding multi-threaded libraries can help. If none of these solutions work, it may be a known or unknown issue with Ray and a GitHub issue should be created with a minimal code example that demonstrates the problem.",

        "answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled, you can use the `object_spilling_config` parameter in the `ray.init` function to configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories to distribute the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices. Additionally, you can adjust the buffer size to reduce IO requests during spilling. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended to specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Furthermore, you can use the `local_fs_capacity_threshold` parameter to allow spilling until the local disk is 99% utilized. Finally, you can enable object spilling to remote storage by using the `smart_open` parameter and specifying the URI of the remote storage.",

        "reasoning": "The answer provides a comprehensive list of options for avoiding objects not getting spilled in Ray, including configuring the spilling directory, distributing IO across multiple physical devices, adjusting the buffer size, allowing spilling until the local disk is 99% utilized, and enabling object spilling to remote storage. The answer also includes recommendations for optimizing performance and reducing IO requests during spilling."
